Going...Going...Gone!
(Austin, December 21) - - The Texas Lottery Commission announced that no claimant stepped forward by the midnight deadline to claim the jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket from the June 23rd drawing, worth an estimated $13 million. Unless the ticket arrives at lottery headquarters by mail with a postmark date of December 20, 2001, the new winner is the state administered Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. The $7.3 million prize money will now be transferred to the account, which funds indigent healthcare at UTMB-Galveston and other facilities throughout the state. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, which would have netted the winner $7.3 million before taxes. The ticket was purchased in Humble, just northeast of Houston. The retailer, Copperfield Liquor #6, located at 7540 FM 1960 east, has already received the one-percent retailer bonus - $130,000 - for selling the top-prize winning ticket. Not since 1995 has a Lotto Texas jackpot gone unclaimed. A ticket worth $12.4 million, purchased for the drawing held October 26, 1994 in Flower Mound, was never turned over to lottery officials in Austin by the deadline date, April 24, 1995. -30.... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
