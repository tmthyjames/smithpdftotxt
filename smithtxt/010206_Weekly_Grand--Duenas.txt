ROSENBERG MAN WINS TOP PRIZE IN WEEKLY GRAND
(AUSTIN) ­Geronimo Dueñas of Rosenberg has won the top prize in Weekly Grand from the Texas Lottery. Mr. Dueñas claimed his prize, which totals $1,040,000 before taxes, at Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin today. He is the 75th winner in the popular game that has been issued 16 times since 1995. Dueñas purchased the ticket at Becerras Grocery, located at 500 Second Street in Rosenberg. The new winner said while he was at another retail location, a customer made him an offer he absolutely had to refuse. "A woman I didn't know at another store said she'd give me $10,000 if I turned the ticket over to her," he said. "That way, she told me, I wouldn't have to worry about all the paperwork and bother of claiming a prize at the lottery. I told her `no,' immediately." "Hang on to your tickets and keep them safe," said Products Manager Robert Tirloni. "Mr. Dueñas was smart to keep his ticket and also to hide it where no one would look, in an old pair of pants hidden away in the closet. We're glad he secured his ticket and made it to Austin to claim his prize." The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the top prize, which comes to $10,000.
