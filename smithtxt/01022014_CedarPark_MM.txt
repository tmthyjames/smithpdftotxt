CEDAR PARK RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Joe Lassiter, of Cedar Park, today claimed a Mega Millions® second-tier prize worth $1 million. The ticket for the Friday, Dec. 20, 2013 drawing was purchased at the 7-Eleven Convenience Store located at 11518 N. FM 620 in Austin.

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but can still walk away winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.

The claimant requested minimal publicity.
