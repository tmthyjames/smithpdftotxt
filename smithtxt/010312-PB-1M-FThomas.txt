POWERBALL® PLAYER FROM DAINGERFIELD CLAIMS
$1 MILLION PRIZE FROM OCTOBER 19 DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Daingerfield resident Fredia Thomas claimed a $1 million Powerball® prize yesterday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler. Thomas's ticket matched all five numbers (16 ­ 26 ­ 35 ­ 52 ­ 58), but not the Powerball (2) drawn on October 19. Since Thomas added the Power Play® option to her ticket for $1 extra, what would have been a $200,000 5-of-5 prize increased to a guaranteed $1 million. The winning ticket was purchased at the Rite Track #15 located at 1304 Linda Drive in Daingerfield. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $30 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $25 million.
