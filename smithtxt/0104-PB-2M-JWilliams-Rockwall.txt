POWERBALL® PURCHASE RESULTS IN $2 MILLION WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ John Williams of Rockwall enjoys playing Powerball® and buys a ticket for each drawing. On Christmas Day he made his usual purchase and on Dec. 26 his Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (11 ­ 13 ­ 23 ­ 43 ­ 54), but not the Powerball (4). Because he selected the Power Play® option, his second-tier prize doubled to $2 million. Williams plans to continue trying for the Powerball jackpot and won't change his routine. "I'll still work. It's not really enough to retire on, but I'm going to take some fabulous vacations." Williams purchased his ticket at his favorite Texas Lottery® retailer, the 7-Eleven Store #16559A located at 102 Kaufman Road in Rockwall. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $39 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed more than $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. The Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Mega Millions®, Powerball, Lotto Texas®, All or NothingTM, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
