AUSTIN MILLION DOLLAR MANIA PLAYER STARTS NEW YEAR OFF WITH $1 MILLION BANG

(AUSTIN) ­ Willie B. Moore of Austin today claimed the first of three $1 million top prizes in the Texas Lottery® Million Dollar Mania scratch-off game. Moore said he'd stopped off to buy gas in north Austin on Tuesday when he noticed a new game on the shelf and decided to give it a shot. "Since it was my first time playing Million Dollar Mania, it took me a little while to figure out how it worked," said Moore. "I scratched off the whole (more)

thing before I realized I'd already won the $1 million at the top of the card; it was pretty hard to believe I'd actually won!" The $20 Million Dollar Mania game debuted on December 26. Moore said he's always been a pretty regular Lotto Texas® player, and he actually won $660 playing Pick 3TM a few years ago, but that his wife was a bigger fan of scratch-off tickets. Not anymore. "It certainly didn't take Million Dollar Mania long to catch on with our players," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "It usually takes more than just of couple of weeks before we see a top-prize winner in a new game, but this just goes to show that you never know when you're going to win." Moore said he hasn't had enough time yet to make any concrete plans for his winnings, but he's definitely going to invest a large portion of it. "I feel very fortunate to have this kind of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you can be sure I'm not going to waste it." Moore purchased his winning ticket at the HLD Food Mart located at 1112 West Koenig Lane in Austin. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. In addition to the $1 million top prizes, the $20 Million Dollar Mania game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $20 to $10,000.
