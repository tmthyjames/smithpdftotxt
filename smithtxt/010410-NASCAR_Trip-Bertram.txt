SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT REVS UP TO ATTEND NASCAR® TRIP WON IN A TEXAS LOTTERY® 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ NASCAR® fan Bob Bertram of San Antonio says he doesn't yet know which NASCAR race he'll attend in 2010, but he's "ready to go" after collecting his prize this week at the Texas Lottery® San Antonio Claim Center.

He won the trip after entering his non-winning Fast Bucks scratch-off ticket in a Texas Lottery second-chance drawing.

"I'm a fan of NASCAR and watch it on TV when I can," Bertram said. "This won't be my first trip to NASCAR, but it sure feels great to know I'm going again. I told everybody I know about this."

"Mr. Bertram's non-winning ticket was selected on December 17 in the last of four second-chance drawings," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "His four-day, three-night trip for two to a race in 2010 should be big fun for someone like him who is already a fan of the sport."

The prize also includes round-trip airfare for two; first-class hotel accommodations; all ground transportation from the airport and race track; reserved seating for two on race days; $500 in spending cash; and two merchandise prize packs.

Bertram says this is the biggest prize he's ever won, and that he plans to keep playing.
