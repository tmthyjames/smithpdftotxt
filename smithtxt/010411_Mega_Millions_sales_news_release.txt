$355 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT PRODUCES RECORD SALES FOR TEXAS LOTTERY®
Jackpot-winning tickets sold in Idaho (1) and Washington (1)
(Austin) ­ Texas Lottery® players purchased more than $12.9 million worth of tickets yesterday for last
night's estimated $355 million Mega Millions® jackpot drawing. That is the highest single-day sales for Mega Millions since Texas joined the game in December 2003. "To say that yesterday's near-record Mega Millions jackpot made for a very busy day for our players and retailers alike would be an understatement," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "We saw sales levels like we've never seen before. Between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. yesterday, Texas retailers sold more than $2.2 million in Mega Millions tickets. That's more than 36,000 tickets per minute." Total sales for the Mega Millions sales period that began on January 1 and continued through the drawing of January 4 also set a new Texas record at $15.8 million. "Due to the increased traffic in lottery retailer locations selling Mega Millions tickets and the popularity of our holiday suite of instant ticket games, we have also been seeing an increase in the sale of instant tickets," Grief said. There were two jackpot-winning Mega Millions tickets sold, one in Idaho and one in Washington state, which matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball from last night's drawing. The tickets will split the grand/jackpot prize, which reached $380 million based on sales. In Texas, there were 383,317 winning tickets sold for last night's drawing with a total value of more than $2.5 million, including one ticket worth $1 million.
