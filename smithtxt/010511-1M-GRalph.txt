PROVIDENCE VILLAGE RESIDENT TURNS HIS NON-WINNING TICKETS INTO A $1 MILLION WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ It wasn't a magic trick. Glen Ralph of Providence Village turned his non-winning Mega Jumbo Bucks III tickets into a $1 million win by simply mailing them in for a second-chance drawing. Ralph requested minimal publicity. Introduced in May 2010, the Mega Jumbo Bucks III scratch-off game features more than $85 million in prizes. Overall odds of winning any instant prize are one in 3.40, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can send in their non-winning Mega Jumbo Bucks III, Giant Jumbo Bucks III and Jumbo Bucks III tickets for the second-chance drawings. The deadline to enter the next drawing is January 28. For specific entry instructions, please visit the official Texas Lottery® website at www.txlottery.org. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $34 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. ###
