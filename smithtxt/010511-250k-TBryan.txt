LUBBOCK OFFICE MAY BE JUMPING AS 17 MEMBERS OF MEGA MILLIONS® POOL CELEBRATE $250,000 WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ Tamara Bryan of Lubbock started today like any other, completely unaware that she and 16 of her coworkers had just won $250,000 in last night's Mega Millions® drawing. "My coworker texted me this morning early and said, `Did you check the numbers?' I'd heard someone won the big one but it wasn't in Texas, so I didn't think anything of it," explained Bryan. "Then she told me that someone won $250,000 at the Stripes." Bryan wasted no time getting online and checking the group's numbers. Sure enough, one set of numbers matched all five numbers drawn (4 ­ 8 ­ 15 ­ 25 ­ 47) but not the Mega Ball (42). "Everyone knows, and we're all so excited. Three of us are here claiming the prize," said Bryan. "We can only imagine the happy atmosphere at Ms. Bryan's office today," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With more than 383,000 prize-winning tickets sold in Texas, players across the state will be celebrating along with these 17 office mates." The group purchased their Quick Pick ticket at the Stripes No. 2253, 2412 98th Street in Lubbock. Last night's Mega Millions drawing set a new record for sales in Texas by bringing in $15.8 million between January 1 and January 4. Two tickets, one sold in Idaho and one sold in Washington state, matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball. Those tickets will split the grand/jackpot prize, which reached $380 million based on final sales figures. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $34 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million.
