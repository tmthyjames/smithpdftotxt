HOUSTON WOMAN USES ONE OF HER LAST STAMPS TO ENTER SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING, WINS $500,000
(AUSTIN) ­ Jeannie Hyman of Houston had only two stamps left when she sent in her entry for the Giant Jumbo Bucks III secondchance drawing, but it was worth every penny when she received word that her entry was drawn for the $500,000 top prize. "I was looking through my bills when I got the call. I didn't believe I'd really won," said Hyman. "I told the man on the phone, `This ain't funny. I'm going to report you to the authorities.'" Asked what she'll do with her winnings, Hyman deadpanned, "I'm going to put the money in IRAs, build a little house on my property and take my son to a Wienerschnitzel." The Giant Jumbo Bucks III game features more than $70 million in prizes. Overall odds of winning any instant prize are one in 3.72, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can enter the second-chance drawing for a chance to win $1,000 or even $500,000. The deadline to enter the next drawing is January 28. For complete drawing rules, prize details and winners lists, please visit the official Texas Lottery website at www.txlottery.org. Hyman sent in just one entry for the drawing, and she advocates playing responsibly. Her advice to other Texas Lottery players is this: "Don't use your grocery money. Play with the money you don't need, and good luck!"
