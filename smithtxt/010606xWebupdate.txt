WHAT'S NEW FOR THE NEW YEAR ­ TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYERS CAN WATCH DRAWINGS LIVE VIA WEBCAST
(AUSTIN) ­ With just a few clicks, Texas Lottery® players can now view all the Pick 3TM, Cash Five®, Texas Two Step®, Lotto Texas®, Mega MillionsTM and MegaplierTM drawings everyday. The latest update on the official Texas Lottery Commission's Web site, www.txlottery.org, features a Webcast link where players can view daily drawings or watch a past drawing. "We've been working toward this feature for players for some time," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's one more way we're trying to get information out fast to our players about their favorite games, and bring the excitement back of finding out instantly if their numbers match those of the drawings." Viewers may link to the video broadcasts of the drawings by using the following formats: Windows Media Player, Real Player, or QuickTime. The Webcast page also allows players to download these video formats for free. Drawings are supervised by lottery security and are not official until certified by the Texas Lottery and the independent auditing firm of Davila, Buschhorn & Associates, P.C. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $15 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $44 million, and Tuesday's Texas Two Step drawing is worth $250,000.
