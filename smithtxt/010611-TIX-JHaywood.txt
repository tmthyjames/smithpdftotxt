AUSTIN RESIDENT WHO HAILS FROM FORT WORTH WINS SEASON TICKETS FOR THE DALLAS COWBOYS
(AUSTIN) ­ Originally from Fort Worth, Jocelyn Haywood of Austin has been a Dallas Cowboys fan for years. She says she sent in two or three non-winning tickets for a recent Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing, and her effort paid off with a pair of tickets between the 30-yard lines for every Cowboys home game next season. "I've been a fan since Roger Staubach, since I was young," says Haywood. "I plan to share the tickets with my family. I can take each one to a game with me." "Football has been bringing Texas families together for decades, and it's good to see that it will do the same for Ms. Haywood and her family," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game features instant cash prizes up to $250,000, but the secondchance prizes are also exciting. Our players can send in their non-winning tickets for chances to win gift cards, autographed jerseys, exclusive trip packages and, of course, season tickets." Overall odds of winning any Dallas Cowboys cash prize are one in 3.47, including break-even prizes. Texas Lottery® players who don't win instantly can enter the second-chance drawings by filling out the back of each non-winning ticket, affixing a first-class stamp and mailing the ticket. Haywood's winning philosophy is simple. "God is good, and anything's possible." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $51 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million.
