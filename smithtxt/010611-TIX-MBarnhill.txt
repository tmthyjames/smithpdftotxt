10-YEAR LOTTERY PLAYER SENDS IN NON-WINNING SCRATCH-OFFS, WINS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS

(Austin) ­ Monte Barnhill of Arlington has been playing the Texas Lottery® for the past 10 years and still enjoys playing the Games of Texas. He recently sent in his non-winning Dallas Cowboys scratch-off tickets for a second-chance drawing and won a pair of tickets between the 30-yard lines for every Cowboys home game next season. "I feel like a little kid again," said Barnhill. "It really does pay to play." "By sending in his non-winning tickets, Mr. Barnhill gave himself a second chance to win. Now, he'll get to enjoy some top-notch football at Cowboys Stadium," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. Other prizes awarded in the Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawings include gift cards, autographed jerseys and exclusive trip packages. To enter the drawings, players can fill out the back of each non-winning ticket, affix a first-class stamp and mail the ticket. Barnhill has one piece of advice for other Texas Lottery players, "You have to play to win." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $51 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million.
