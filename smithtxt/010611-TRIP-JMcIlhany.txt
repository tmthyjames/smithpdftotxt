TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM ALICE WINS "ONCE IN A LIFETIME" SECOND-CHANCE PRIZE

(Austin) ­ Julia A. McIlhany of Alice says there is only one secret behind her Dallas Cowboys "Draft Party Trip"; she didn't give up. She sent in her non-winning Dallas Cowboys tickets for a secondchance drawing and won a "once in a lifetime" chance to go inside the War Room on Draft Day for an inside look at the Cowboys draft player evaluation and strategies by Jerry Jones. Her prize also includes two VIP tickets to the Dallas Cowboys Draft Party and transportation to the party aboard the Dallas Cowboys Luxury Bus. According to McIlhany, "You have to keep playing and send your tickets in for the secondchance drawings." Other second-chance prizes include gift cards, autographed jerseys and season tickets. "The Dallas Cowboys game was a success for us last year, and it's even bigger this year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Featuring more than $43 million in cash and prizes, this game offers players chances to win up to $250,000 instantly or exciting prizes and trips through the second-chance drawings." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $51 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million.
