CALIFORNIA RESIDENT FLIES TO EL PASO TO COLLECT $250,000 MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(Austin) ­ During a drive from Kansas City, Missouri, to his home in San Jose, California, Andre Noble stopped at the Express Lane #3 located at 624 Denver in Dalhart, Texas. He purchased a ticket for the Mega Millions® drawing held on December 20. "About two days after I got home, I checked my Mega Millions numbers and was really shocked," said Noble. "The only one around was my pops at the time, and we both were very happy." Noble's ticket matched all five numbers (20 ­ 24 ­ 27 ­ 45 ­ 51) but not the Mega Ball (31). He claimed his $250,000 second-tier prize at the Texas Lottery® claim center in El Paso yesterday. "It's great to have visitors from other states enjoy our games during their time in Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We congratulate Mr. Noble on his good fortune and invite him to visit the Lone Star State again in the future." A regular lottery player in his home state, Noble had already settled on a plan for his winnings. "I will buy a house." Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $25 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $44 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $11 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit www.txlottery.org. ###
