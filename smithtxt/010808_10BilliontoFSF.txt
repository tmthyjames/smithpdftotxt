$10 BILLION-MILESTONE REACHED WITH LATEST TRANSFER TO FOUNDATION SCHOOL FUND
(AUSTIN) ­ Transfers of Texas Lottery® dollars to the state's Foundation School Fund (FSF) have now surpassed the $10 billion mark. "This is a significant milestone that we've reached," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "With December's deposit of more than $86.5 million, we've exceeded the $10 billion mark. With the support of our players and retailers, we expect to continue providing support to the Foundation School Fund, which benefits public education in Texas." Beginning September 1, 1997, the Lottery was directed by the Texas Legislature to transfer money from sales directly to the Foundation School Fund. Prior to that, Lottery monies were dedicated to the General Revenue Fund. Since fiscal year 2004, the Lottery has sent more than $1 billion each year to the FSF. Since inception of the Lottery in 1992, Texas Lottery players have won more than $27.6 billion in prizes. Retailer bonuses and commissions have exceeded $2.4 billion.
