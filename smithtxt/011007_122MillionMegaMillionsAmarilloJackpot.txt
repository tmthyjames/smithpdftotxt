PANHANDLE HAS MEGA MILLIONS® BRAGGING RIGHTS; $122 MILLION JACKPOT TICKET SOLD IN AMARILLO
(Austin)-- One ticket sold in Amarillo matched the five numbers and the Mega Ball number from last night's Mega Millions® drawing. The advertised estimated jackpot was $122 million. The quick pick ticket was sold with the Cash Value Option, which allows the claimant to receive a one-time lump sum that is approximately half of the advertised jackpot. That amount comes to $73,572,690. "Someone is starting off their new year in very big way," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony Sadberry. "Since Texas joined the Mega Millions multi-state game in December of 2003, there have been three jackpot winning tickets sold and now we have four. Also, it's the largest Mega Millions jackpot ever won in Texas. The highest was $112 million from 2003." Taylor Petroleum Companies Inc. #80, 3400 Coulter Drive, sold the ticket and is eligible to receive a bonus of $1 million. Of the more than 2.8 million tickets sold in Texas for last night's drawing, approximately 90,000 tickets won lower- tier prizes that totaled more than $500,000. The numbers drawn were 54-11-7-38-26, and the Mega Ball was 13. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million.
