CORPUS CHRISTI RESIDENT PROVES SEVERAL TIMES OVER THAT "YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY"
(Austin) ­ Felix Guajardo of Corpus Christi has claimed a prize of $1,000 that resulted from the Mega Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawing in which he had entered his non-winning Mega Jumbo Bucks III tickets. This was the fifth prize from a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing that Guajardo has won in the last 12 months. In August, Guajardo won $1,000 in the first of the Mega Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawings. In separate December drawings, he won a Houston Texans autographed team jersey and a Dallas Cowboys $100 gift card. In a drawing early last summer he won a pair of season tickets to the 2010 Dallas Cowboys football season that just ended. "I had the best seats in the house," Guajardo said of attending the football games. "I sat between the 30-yard-lines at the games, and it was awesome. You could almost touch the players." "Mr. Guajardo's wins show why we call these `second-chance' drawings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "By consistently entering his non-winning scratchoff tickets in the appropriate second-chance drawings, Mr. Guajardo has won a range of prizes from a gift card and an autographed jersey to season tickets and cash, all of which are the kinds of prizes that make our second-chance drawings so popular among players." Guajardo said he regularly checks the lottery website to look for his name in the lists of secondchance drawing winners. One thing remains constant for him in entering the second-chance drawings; "You can't win if you don't play." (more)
