EACH FAMILY MEMBER SCRATCHED PART OF $3,000,000 TEXAS HOLIDAY RICHES TICKET AND FOUND TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Scott Wheat of Sunset and his parents were sitting at the dining room table one evening last week engaging in a long-standing family activity; each one scratched a part of the same Texas Lottery® ticket. It was a $3,000,000 Texas Holiday Riches, but this time they discovered they'd won $3 million. "At first, my parents and I couldn't believe it," Wheat said. "We kept looking at the ticket and passing it around. Then we realized we had won and started screaming and hollering and hugging each other. We've been sharing the scratching of lottery tickets since the lottery started. It's just something we do every week." Wheat stashed the ticket in a fire-proof safe at home, but later put the ticket in a safe deposit box at his bank. "The fact is that our players have many different ways of playing their favorite lottery games, and this is one such example that has clearly brought fun and entertainment to the Wheat family for many years, said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry." Wheat bought the ticket at the Quick Stop Grocery, 801 Highway 59 North in Bowie. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold this ticket.
