HURST MAN CLAIMS TOP PRIZE IN WEEKLY GRAND SCRATCH GAME FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Brad Doskocil of Hurst has claimed the top prize of $1,000 per week for 20 years in the Weekly Grand scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. The total prize after 20 years is $1,040,000. Doskocil purchased the ticket on December 25 while he was on his way to his father's house for Christmas festivities. "I bought two tickets, got some gas and went to my dad's," he said. "While I was there, my sister scratched the ticket for me. I plan to pay off some bills, including a new Jeep that I bought three months ago, and then play it by ear." Doskocil bought the ticket at the 7-Eleven #1631-27328, located at 3011 State Highway 121 in Euless. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold this ticket. This is the first of the three top prizes in the $2 game (#732) to be claimed. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $24 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
