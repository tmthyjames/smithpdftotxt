ARLINGTON WOMAN WINS TOP PRIZE IN CADILLAC® ESCALADETM CASH NOT KNOWING SHE COULD WIN A VEHICLE (Austin) ­ Jennifer Johnson of Arlington bought a Cadillac® Escalade TM Cash ticket thinking the top prize was in cash. It didn't occur to her that even though there is a cash prize of $50,000 in the game, the top prize was a fabulous vehicle.

"I enjoy buying scratch-off tickets because they pay out great cash prizes, so I didn't think it would be different when I bought the Cadillac ticket," she said. "I scratched a small part of the prize section and got what I thought were two zeros. It turned out those `zeros' were the bottom parts of car tires on the Cadillac symbol that appeared in the prize area."

As with so many other Lottery winners, her family, Johnson said, didn't believe her when she called to tell them. The whole experience has left her breathless and a little dumbfounded.

"What I feel is overwhelmed," she said. "First, nobody believes me or my husband when we tell them we've won this prize, and second, it's just strange to know you've won this incredible prize and not have it yet."

"Ms. Johnson's vehicle is a custom-made hybrid and will be constructed to her specifications and delivered," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the last of the three top prizes offered in the game, so the gameclosing procedures have begun."
