WACO RESIDENT KNOWS "2011'S GOING TO BE A GOOD YEAR" WITH $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER WIN
(Austin) ­ Elizabeth Farley of Waco has been in shock since she discovered she purchased a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket worth $2.5 million. There is one thing she knows for sure, "2011's going to be a good year." "I scratched off two or three of these, and I think it was the third one that won," explained Farley. "I checked it in the machine, and it said to contact the lottery claim center. That's how I knew it was really a winner." Farley, who requested minimal publicity, wasted no time gathering her long-time best friend and driving to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim her prize. "It certainly sounds like Ms. Farley has found her game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "She claimed the seventh top prize in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster, but three top prizes of $2.5 million each and 14 second-tier prizes of $1 million still remain unclaimed." With more than half a billion dollars in total prizes, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster features overall odds of one in 2.77 of winning any prize, including break-even prizes. The Dallas Food Mart located at 1210 New Dallas Highway in Bellmead is eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $30 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $82 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million.
