DALLAS COWBOYS AND HOUSTON TEXANS DRAWINGS POSTPONED DUE TO WEATHER

(Austin) ­ The Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans second-chance drawings that were scheduled for this week have been postponed due to inclement weather in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. Hazardous driving conditions in some areas are preventing personnel from Scientific Games International, the vendor contracted to conduct the drawings, from traveling to the drawing site in Dallas. The drawings will be rescheduled, and the dates will be posted on the Texas Lottery® website at www.txlottery.org. ###
