BROWNSBORO BIG MONEY PLAYER'S "LUCKY DAY" HELPS HIM LAND A $100,000 TOP PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Charles Privett of Brownsboro knew just what to wear when he headed to the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler today to cash in a winning scratch-off ticket. For Privett, it was an obvious choice to wear the "Maybe It's Your Lucky Day" T-shirt he'd picked up on a previous visit to claim a prize. Today, Privett walked out with a lot more than the shirt on his back--he also walked away with a Big Money top prize of $100,000. Privett, a longtime Texas Lottery player, said he was "pretty emotional" when he realized how much he'd won, and he already has a plan for what to do with his winnings. "I was about to cry after I saw what I had," said Privett. "I can use this money to put my kids through college!" With more than $29 million in total prizes, the $10 Big Money features 20 ways to win and overall odds of winning any prize of one in 3.35, including break-even prizes. Privett's $100,000 prize was the first of nine in the game. There are also currently 16 unclaimed second-tier prizes of $10,000. "I want to congratulate Mr. Privett for both his good luck and for his good plan to use his prize to fund his children's education," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Texas Lottery supports education in Texas and has contributed more than $13 billion to the state's Foundation School Fund." Privett purchased his ticket at One Stop located at 12666 State Highway 31 W. in Tyler. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $42 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $66 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, visit www.txlottery.org. ###
