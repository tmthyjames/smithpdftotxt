BIGGER! BETTER! MORE! SALES FOR NEW $2 POWERBALL® GAME START SUNDAY 
(AUSTIN) ­ Bigger starting grand/jackpot prizes, better odds of winning and more chances to win $1  million await Texas Lottery® players when sales for the new Powerball game begin Jan. 15, 2012. The  first drawing for the new game occurs on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2012. The cost to play the game will  increase from $1 to $2 per play.  Starting jackpots for the new Powerball game will double to $40 million and a matrix change will  provide better odds of winning. Players will continue to choose five numbers from one to 59, but the  pool of Powerball numbers will drop from 39 to 35. Odds of winning the grand/jackpot prize will  improve to one in 175,223,510, and overall odds of winning any prize will improve to one in 32.  An exciting aspect of the new Powerball will be more opportunities for players to win $1 million or  more. The secondtier prize, awarded for matching all five numbers, but not the Powerball number,  will increase from $200,000 to $1 million.   "We believe our players will enjoy the pricepoint variety the new $2 Powerball game provides, as  well as the excitement of the bigger jackpots, better odds and more chances to win $1 million," said  Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Players who prefer to spend $1 per play  can still participate in the Lotto Texas® and Mega Millions® drawing games."  Players will also be able to participate in the revamped Power Play® feature for an extra $1 per play.  Power Play will now offer set increases for nongrand/jackpot prizes, including the chance to win $2  million for the secondtier prize.  Jurisdictions participating in Powerball include 42 states, Washington D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Texas Powerball sales began on January 31, 2010. Powerball drawings are held on Wednesday and  Saturday nights at 10:12 p.m. Proceeds from Powerball benefit Texas education.
