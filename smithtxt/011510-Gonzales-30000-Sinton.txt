MOM'S POTS AND PANS TO HAVE MORE BREATHING ROOM, THANKS TO SON'S WIN OF $30,000 PLAYING TRIPLER
(Austin) ­ Billy Gonzales of Sinton will soon embark on a revamp of his mother's kitchen, thanks to a $30,000 top prize he won playing the Tripler scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®.

"My mom has always wanted a bigger kitchen," Gonzales said. "With the $30,000 I won, I can give that to her and also do some work on the exterior of her house. I'm not sure when she wants me to start, but it'll be soon."

Gonzales bought one Tripler ticket Thursday on his way home from work with a companion. The lone scratch-off ticket he bought spent the night in his truck.

"I wasn't planning to stop, but he wanted to, so I figured while I was in there, I might as well buy a ticket and get my Mega Millions, too," he said. "The Tripler caught my eye. I bought it and put it in the console of my truck and didn't think about it until this morning. Everybody's been asking me about leaving that ticket in the truck overnight, too."

Gonzales called his mother from his truck this morning immediately after scratching the ticket.

"I was kind of shocked because right before I scratched the ticket, I was thinking about breakfast," he said. "When I called, she told me not to spend it all in one place and to take care of it. But, she got really excited when I told her I was going to re-do her kitchen."
