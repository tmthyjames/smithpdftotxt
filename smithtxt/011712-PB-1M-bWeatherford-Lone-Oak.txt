LONE OAK POWERBALL® PLAYER CLAIMS $1 MILLION PRIZE FROM JANUARY 7 DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Brenda K. Weatherford of Lone Oak claimed a $1 million Powerball® prize yesterday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler. Weatherford's ticket matched all five numbers (3 ­ 21 ­ 24 ­ 38 ­ 39), but not the Powerball (24) drawn on January 7. Since Weatherford added the Power Play® option to her ticket for $1 extra, what would have been a $200,000 5-of-5 prize increased to a guaranteed $1 million. The winning ticket was purchased at the Short Stop located at 508 U.S. Highway 69 N. in Lone Oak. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $80 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $14 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $60 million.
