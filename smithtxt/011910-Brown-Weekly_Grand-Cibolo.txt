NEWLY-MINTED TEXAN GETS A `GRAND' WELCOME TO LONE STAR STATE WINNING WEEKLY GRAND TOP PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Preston Brown moved to Texas with his mother, Anita, and stepfather, Thomas Atwood, in October from Dayton, Ohio, and got the welcome of his life. The Cibolo resident won the Weekly Grand top prize of $1,000 per week for 20 years.

"I feel like I've been welcomed in `grand' style," Brown said. "I bought four tickets and saved the big one to scratch last. That's how I do it. When I saw the word `grand' on the ticket and then the rest of the prize, I had to show my mother to make sure I was really seeing what I thought the ticket said."

Brown rushed back to the store where he had purchased the ticket to run the ticket through the self-service scanner provided by the Texas Lottery®. The scanner message directed Brown to come to Lottery headquarters in Austin to claim his prize.

"I bought the ticket on Sunday evening, and it didn't really hit me what I'd won, so I was cool that night," he said. "The next day, though, I was ready to get here. I spent all of Martin Luther King, Jr., Day thinking about my prize while I was at work."

"You could call this win a Texas-size welcome to the state," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Weekly Grand has been a huge success since it first went on sale in 1995. The current issue of the game still has two top prizes remaining."
