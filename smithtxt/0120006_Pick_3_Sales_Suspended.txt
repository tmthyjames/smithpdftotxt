TEXAS LOTTERY COMMISSION SUSPENDS PICK 3TM SALES
(Austin) ­ This afternoon, the Texas Lottery Commission suspended sales for the Pick 3TM game after GTECH Corporation, the lottery operator, notified the Commission of a printing problem associated with the generation of tickets. Pick 3 tickets purchased on Friday, January 20, 2006, for a "Day Draw" may say "Night Draw," but the printing error should not affect Pick 3 drawings or ticket validations. GTECH Corporation has identified the cause of the problem and indicated it is in the process of correcting it. Pick 3 sales will resume when the problem has been corrected. GTECH Corporation will make payment on all Pick 3 tickets that appear to be winners but cannot be validated in the gaming system due to the Pick 3 problems identified today. If players have questions about a ticket, they should not discard the ticket before contacting the Texas Lottery Customer Service line, 1-800-375-6886,

during normal business hours. Draws for the Pick 3 game will continue as scheduled. The Texas Lottery Commission regrets any inconvenience this problem may have caused players. ...
