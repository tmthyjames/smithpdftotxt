THE MARK MONROE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TRUST OF SAN ANTONIO CLAIMS SHARE OF $8 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® CHRISTMAS EVE JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ A "What-the-heck, it's Christmas" feeling came over Mark Monroe and impelled him to purchase five Quick Pick Lotto Texas® tickets when he stopped in at the EZ Mart 574 on Dover Ridge in San Antonio the night before Christmas. As it turned out, that purchase brought him the Christmas present of his life, a jackpot prize worth $2.9 million. His ticket was one of two that matched the numbers drawn December 24. The Mark Monroe Property Management Trust, Mark Monroe, Trustee, has claimed the prize of $2,980,622.40, which is the Cash Value Option amount before taxes are removed. Monroe left the ticket in the door pocket of his car for several days. "After I checked the ticket and spoke to the staff at the Lottery Claim Center in San Antonio, they told me I would have to come to Austin," Monroe said. "I put the ticket where I thought it would be safe, which was my ammunition box. My attorney convinced me to put it in a lockbox in the bank, where it's been until today." Monroe says he plans to use some of his prize to help his family and leave the rest in the trust.

"I'm going to help out my sisters with some of their financial issues," he said. "One of them said all she wants is new carpeting, which she will get. I also plan to help out the church we attended in Thousand Oaks, California, because it suffered a fire not long ago." Monroe says he plans to be back quickly at the school where he volunteers. The military veteran is a Cubmaster and involved in Cub Scout recruitment. "This prize has given me lots to think about," he said. "One thing I can say, though, is that an ounce of luck is better than a pound of gold." "Helping out family members is a great way to start enjoying a Lottery prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This claim closes the book on the December 24, 2008, $8 million Lotto Texas jackpot. The other half was claimed last week by The Morris Family Trust, Delbert Eugene Morris, Trustee, of Arlington." The store where the trustee purchased the ticket, EZ Mart 574, 10250 Dover Ridge, in San Antonio, is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the prize, which comes to $40,000. The trustee of the Mark Monroe Property Management Trust requested minimal publicity. The numbers drawn were 11--28--32--49--51--53. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $21 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million.
