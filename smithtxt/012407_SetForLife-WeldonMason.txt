FORT WORTH RESIDENT NABS $5 MILLION TOP PRIZE IN TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH GAME, SET FOR LIFE
(AUSTIN) ­ Weldon K. Mason of Fort Worth has won the top prize of $5 million, or $5,000 per week for 20 years, after buying one ticket of the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Set For Life. He collected his prize at Lottery headquarters in Austin. Mason was sitting at his desk at work when he scratched the ticket. "I saw the word, `LIFE," on the ticket and thought that it couldn't be right," he said. "I looked at it again and realized what I had, folded it and put it in my pocket where it stayed the rest of the day until I got home." Mason purchased the ticket at the Tetco #459, 9401 White Settlement Road, in Fort Worth. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold this ticket. Set for Life has been issued four times by the Texas Lottery. This is the first of the two top prizes in this game (#723) to be claimed. The winner requested minimal publicity. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $43 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million.
