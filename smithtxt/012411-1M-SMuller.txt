FIRST $1 MILLION PRIZE CLAIMED IN NEW

TEXAS LOTTERY® BLACK SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(Austin) ­ On a recommendation from a clerk at DD's Express Mart, 600 Graham Road in College Station, Steve Muller of College Station purchased a $10 Texas Lottery® Black scratch-off ticket. The ticket wasn't a winner, so Muller asked for one more. When he scratched the second ticket, it revealed the first of six top prizes of $1 million each in the game, but this isn't the first prize won by this Texas Lottery® player. "I won $5,000 on a $3 ticket, and I won $1,000 on a $1 ticket," explained Muller. "Here's the key to playing the lottery ­ Play what you can afford and don't expect to win, just have fun." For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Muller is a regular customer at DD's Express Mart and said, "I'm glad they are getting something, too. They all work hard over there." "Every so often, we hear about winners who bought their lucky tickets based on the retailer's recommendation, and it reminds us that our retailers are out there every day working to provide a positive experience for our customers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Thanks in part to the hard work of our retailers, we had our fourth best sales year ever in fiscal year 2010, and sales for fiscal year 2011 are currently more than $6 million ahead of sales for the same time period last year."
