WINNING, SHWINNING ­ HOUSTON RESIDENT DOESN'T LET LATEST CASH PRIZE FAZE HIM AT ALL
(AUSTIN) ­ Most people might think winning a prize, like $100,000 from the Texas Lottery, could send you off dancing, yelling and screaming with excitement. Even more might wonder at the sheer joy of winning a significant amount twice in just a few years. And then there's Edward Sanders of Houston, who might just hold the record for remaining the coolest, calmest and most collected recipient of a cash prize, ever. Sanders won the top prize, $2 million, for the Texas Lottery Holiday Millionaire Scratch-Off game, and by the way, that's on top of the $100,000 he won in July 2003. "I paid off my car and bills with that first big prize," Sanders said. "The same thing is going to happen this time, too. I plan to pay off my house and put some away for my children's college tuition." The $30 ticket offers players a chance to win other cash prizes ranging from $30 to $20,000. The overall odds of winning any prize, including breakeven prizes, are 1 in 2.17. "It seems Mr. Sanders might have a sixth sense for picking out just the right instant ticket for a nice payout," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "We congratulate him on his latest win, and hopefully we'll get an opportunity to speak to him again in the future." Sanders told lottery officials he's thinking of going back into the restaurant business. "I owned a restaurant at one time and I would like to open another, serve Cajun-style food," he said.

Sanders purchased his ticket at the Chevron Food Mart, located at 3405 W. Little York Road in Houston. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. "I was visiting a friend when I remembered I hadn't scratched the ticket," Sanders explained. "When I finished scratching it and saw that $TWO MILL show up, I kept thinking, `Oh my, this can't be real.' I had my friend take a look at it, too. I was busy dancing because winning can really make you jump around." A claimant is not considered a winner until a ticket is presented and validated either at Lottery Headquarters in Austin or at a Texas Lottery claim center.
