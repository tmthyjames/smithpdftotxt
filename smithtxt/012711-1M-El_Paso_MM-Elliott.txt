EL PASO RESIDENT WINS MEGA MILLIONS® SECOND-TIER PRIZE OF $1 MILLION
(Austin) ­ Kevin G. Elliott of El Paso claimed $1 million, the second-tier prize in the Mega Millions® drawing on Friday, January 14. A second-tier Mega Millions prize is worth $250,000, but if the player also purchases the Megaplier® feature, the second-tier prize is a guaranteed $1 million, regardless of the Megaplier number drawn. "This is the first Mega Millions second-tier prize of $1 million awarded under the new rule that took effect January 4 and allows this guaranteed prize, irrespective of the Megaplier number drawn," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mr. Elliott's win marks a noteworthy moment in the history of Mega Millions, which has been played in Texas since December of 2003." Elliott bought the ticket at the 7-Eleven #618, 10300 McCombs, in El Paso. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $77 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $19 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $25 million.
