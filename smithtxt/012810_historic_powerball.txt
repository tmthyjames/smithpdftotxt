  Historic Agreement Brings Powerball® to Texas Beginning January 31    
Multistate game to generate additional revenue for the Foundation School Fund      Austin ­ In the largest lottery agreement in U.S. history, Powerball® and Mega Millions® will launch their  partnership this weekend, creating the largest market ever for jackpot games.  As of this Sunday, the Texas  Lottery® will begin sales of Powerball tickets at 16,000plus licensed retailer outlets around the state.  Texas players will have their first chance to win in the Powerball drawing on Wednesday, February 3.     Powerball joins the popular Mega Millions game which has been available in Texas since 2003.  Thirty three jurisdictions, representing a combined population of 199 million people and 147,000 retail outlets,  will offer the two multijurisdiction jackpot games, giving Texas Lottery players four opportunities a week  to play for large jackpots. The market for these games has the potential to expand to 45 jurisdictions  representing 291 million people and 182,000 retail outlets.    "We are excited to add Powerball to our mix of games, and we welcome the new states to Mega Millions.  As the number of people playing both games increases, we could see jackpots rising higher and faster than  ever before," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief.    Since Powerball's inception on February 10, 1988, and Mega Millions' inception on August 31, 1996, the  games have generated an astonishing $17.6 billion for good causes in the states where they are played,  causes such as education, senior programs, local towns and the environment. In Texas, Powerball is  projected to generate $35 million per fiscal year in additional revenue for the Foundation School Fund,  which supports public education in Texas.    "Our mission is to generate revenue for the state of Texas," said Grief. "This agreement between Mega  Millions and Powerball will allow us to do just that. Ultimately, Texas education will be the big winner."    To mark the introduction of Powerball to Texas, the Texas Lottery is planning special Customer  Appreciation Days at lottery retailer locations throughout the state during the month of February.
