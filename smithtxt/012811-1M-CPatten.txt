SCRATCH-OFF FAN FROM EULESS WINS $1 MILLION TOP PRIZE INTEXAS LOTTERY® BLACK
(Austin) ­ Although it was just introduced on January 17, the Texas Lottery® Black scratch-off game has already awarded its second prize of $1 million. Calvin Patten of Euless claimed the top prize today at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Fort Worth. "I scratched the ticket right there at the store where I bought it," explained Patten. "I ran it under the machine, and it said to contact the lottery, so I knew I'd won more than $600. I scratched the rest of the ticket real slow, and when I saw the prize, I couldn't believe it." Asked about his plans for the money, Patten said, "We're going to be getting a house and maybe a car or two and putting money aside for college tuition for my daughter. This is going to let us keep working and be a little more comfortable." "It seems appropriate for Mr. Patten to use a portion of his winnings toward his child's education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "After all, approximately 27 cents of every dollar earned by the Texas Lottery goes to the Foundation School Fund to support public education in the state." With more than $44 million in total prizes, the Texas Lottery® Black ticket features overall odds of winning any prize of one in 3.32, including break-even prizes. Four top prizes of $1 million each remain unclaimed. Patten says the key to winning is persistence. "Just keep playing, and it could happen to you."
