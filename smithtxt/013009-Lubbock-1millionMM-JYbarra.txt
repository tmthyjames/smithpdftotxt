LUBBOCK WOMAN WINS PRIZE WORTH $1 MILLION PLAYING MEGA MILLIONS®
(AUSTIN) ­ Lubbock resident Juanita Ybarra has claimed a Mega Millions® second-tier prize worth $1 million. Hers was one of three second-tier prizes that matched five of the six numbers drawn in last Friday's Mega Millions drawing. After paying an additional dollar to Megaply her ticket and then matching five numbers minus the bonus number, Ybarra's ticket was worth $1 million. She bought her ticket at the 7 - Eleven #408 located at 4401 19th Street in Lubbock. Players can increase their non-jackpot prize winnings by two, three or four times for an additional dollar per playboard. Since Texas joined Mega Millions in December of 2003, four secondtier Mega Millions tickets have been sold in Lubbock. One of those, sold for the drawing on March 11, 2005, carried a megaplied prize of $700,000 that was never claimed. Ybarra requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $40 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $14 million.
