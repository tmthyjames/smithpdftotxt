Houston Woman Megaplies Mega Millions® Ticket to win $1 Million In Tuesday's Drawing
(Austin, January 31) - Vick Edmond Gardner of Houston spent an extra dollar and purchased the Megaplier feature when she bought a Mega Millions® ticket for the drawing on Tuesday, January 24. The ticket she purchased correctly matched five of the six numbers drawn, which provides a prize of $250,000. The Megaplier number that was drawn was four, which allows the player who purchased the feature to multiply the prize by that number. In Gardner's case, that turned the prize into $1 million. The numbers drawn were 3134-36-51-55, and the Mega Ball also was four. "By taking advantage of the Megaplier feature, a player can match only five of six numbers, not win the Mega Millions jackpot and still come away with $1 million," said Texas Lottery Commission Acting Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Not a bad deal for an extra dollar." Gardner bought the ticket at Usave Market, 7403 Vogel Road, in Houston. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $61 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $59 million.
