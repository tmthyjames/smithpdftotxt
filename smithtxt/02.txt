Fort Worth Lotto Texas Winner Doesn't Waste Any Time Collecting His $6 Million Jackpot Prize
(Austin, December 20) - - Today, as time almost runs out to collect one Lotto Texas jackpot prize, Anthony Vernon of Fort Worth made sure he beat the clock in plenty of time to receive his. Vernon held the sole jackpot-winning ticket from the Saturday, November 24th Lotto drawing. He chose the 25-year annuity payment and received the first installment of $240,000. The Vernon Family Trust will receive the same amount every November for the next 24 years. "It seems like a lifetime ago for me," said Vernon. "I heard about that other ticket. I can't believe it, maybe the person lost it or wasn't paying attention." The ticket Vernon refers to is the $13 million Lotto Texas prize-winner sold in Humble for the June 23rd drawing. At midnight tonight, the 180-day deadline expires to collect the $7.3 million Cash Value Option payout for that ticket. "Time just stopped when I saw I had matched all six numbers," said Vernon. "I was reading the paper (Fort Worth Star Telegram) the next morning, and held my ticket up to the numbers in the paper and they were printed in the exact same order." Vernon told lottery officials, he went to the store where he bought the ticket just to make sure. He said the clerk "got real excited" when the ticket came back as a winning one. It was the first time he had ever purchased tickets at that location, and not only did he match all six numbers, his other Lotto ticket netted him $135 more when four of the six numbers matched for the same drawing. Both Quick Pick tickets were purchased at the Ramsey Grocery, located at 1201 E. Ramsey Avenue in Fort Worth. For selling the jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket, Ramsey Grocery owners are eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent - $60,000 - of the jackpot amount. "I'm getting it all in perspective," said Vernon. "I definitely want a new car, and this will definitely help with the family needs. I have three children, my fiancée has six, we have six grandkids and one on the way." As of today, there are two jackpot-winning Lotto Texas tickets outstanding. If no one steps forward to claim the Humble winning ticket before it expires tonight, the money remains unclaimed and will be transferred to the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. The second outstanding ticket was one of two jackpot-winning Lotto tickets that matched all six numbers for the drawing held Saturday, November 17th. It was purchased in Houston at Randall's #3067, located at 5161 San Felipe Suite 200. The prizewinner chose the 25-year annuity, which will payout $80,000 every year over the next 25 years. Joel Conway of Euless claimed the other jackpot-winning ticket for the same drawing. For choosing the Cash Value Option payout on his ticket, Conway received $1,147,192 on Tuesday, November 27th. -30....
