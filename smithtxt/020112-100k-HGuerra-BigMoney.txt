CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER SET TO GO ON VACATION AFTER $100,000 BIG MONEY WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ Corpus Christi resident and longtime Texas Lottery® player Hector Guerra was sitting in his living room when he found out his Big Money scratch-off ticket was a big winner, but he may be found lounging elsewhere soon. "I plan to go on vacation and pay some bills," said Guerra. Guerra has played Texas Lottery scratch-off games for years but says it didn't prepare him to win such a substantial prize. "I was in shock," said Guerra. With more than $29 million in prizes, Big Money offers players a one in 3.35 chance of winning any prize, including break-even prizes. Seven $100,000 top prizes and 15 prizes of $10,000 each currently remain unclaimed. "While we enjoy meeting all of our winners, it is especially gratifying to see a loyal player win. Of course, with more than $13 billion in transfers to the Foundation School Fund since 1997, Texas education remains the biggest winner of all," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. Guerra purchased his Big Money ticket at the Lone Star Market #2 located at 5758 Greenwood Drive in Corpus Christi. Tonight's Powerball ® jackpot is an estimated $170 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $18 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $23 million.
