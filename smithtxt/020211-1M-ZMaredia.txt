SUGAR LAND RESIDENT CLAIMS $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER PRIZE WORTH $1 MILLION
(Austin) ­ Zahara R Maredia of Sugar Land claimed the 27th prize of $1 million in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game from the Texas Lottery®, but 13 prizes of $1 million and three prizes of $2.5 million still remain unclaimed. With more than half a billion dollars in total prizes, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster features overall odds of winning any prize of one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. "The $500,000,000 Blockbuster is a popular game among our players and frequently shows up in our list of top-ten scratch-off games for sales," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "In fact, it ranked as the number two game last week just behind the recently introduced Texas Lottery Black instant ticket." Maredia, who requested minimal publicity, isn't the only one who stands to benefit from this win. For selling the winning ticket, the Bargain Food Mart, 1908 W. 18th St. in Houston, is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $35 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website at www.txlottery.org. ###
