LOTTO TEXAS® TICKET SOLD IN MCALLEN AND WORTH $6 MILLION EXPIRES NEXT MONDAY
(Austin) ­ A Lotto Texas® ticket worth an advertised $6 million that matched the numbers selected in the drawing on August 11, 2010, expires on Monday, February 7. "Players have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim an online jackpot, and the deadline for this Lotto Texas ticket from the August 11, 2010, drawing is next Monday," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We encourage players to search their homes, their wallets and purses, and even their vehicles, if they purchased a Lotto Texas ticket early last August. They may find a reason to come to Austin very soon." The advertised jackpot was $6 million, but the ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, which makes the lump sum prize worth $4,129,116, before taxes. The numbers drawn were 4-21-24-48-40-43. Express Business Services, 1501 W. Highway 83 in McAllen, sold the ticket. The Texas Lottery® awarded the retailer its bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, $60,000, in early October of last year. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $35 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million.
