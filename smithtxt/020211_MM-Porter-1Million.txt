PORTER RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING MEGA MILLIONS® FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­ Damian L. Yanuaria of Porter has claimed a prize of $1 million in the Mega Millions® online game, won after correctly matching the numbers selected in the Friday, January 28, drawing. He claimed his prize in the Houston Claim Center this week. "As a result of a rule change that became effective in January, a player may possibly win a guaranteed second-tier prize of $1 million in Mega Millions as long as the Megaplier® option also has been purchased, as Mr. Yanuaria did," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. The numbers selected in last Friday night's Mega Millions drawing were 33-8-50-49-14, and the Mega Ball was 18. Yanuaria purchased the ticket at the Cleveland Shell, 814 Highway 59 and 105, in Cleveland. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $35 million. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $12 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
