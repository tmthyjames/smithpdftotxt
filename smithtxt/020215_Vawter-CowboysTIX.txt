THE WOODLANDS WOMAN WINS DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS IN TEXAS LOTTERY® SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Calling it "awesome," Rubina Vawter of The Woodlands said she was "screaming and shouting" for joy after learning from Texas Lottery® officials that she won a pair of tickets to the home games of the Dallas Cowboys this fall. "When I got the call, I started dancing and calling everyone," Vawter said. "I was extremely excited and still am. This is what I wanted!" "Our second-chance drawings have prizes of all kinds that will make you jump for joy, as Ms. Vawter did," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The prize Ms. Vawter won came from the fourth of our five second-chance drawings. We have not yet set the date for the last of these." Vawter said she plays only the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game and no other because she planned to enter the second-chance drawings. "I wanted to win season tickets, and you have to play to win." She told lottery officials she plans to share her prize with her husband, her kids and one of her girlfriends, all solid Dallas Cowboys fans. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $40 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $24 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $101 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
