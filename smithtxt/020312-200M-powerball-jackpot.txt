$2 POWERBALL® JACKPOT CLIMBS TO $200 MILLION
$1 Million Second-Tier Powerball Prize Still Unclaimed (AUSTIN) ­ Just two and a half weeks after the launch of the new $2 Powerball® game, the estimated grand/jackpot prize has soared to $200 million. No one matched all five numbers (8-1317-34-59) plus the Powerball (35) for the drawing held Feb. 2. As a result, Powerball players will have a shot at the biggest prize so far this year. "The new $2 Powerball game promises bigger starting jackpots, better odds of winning and more chances to win $1 million. Already, players in Texas are reaping the benefits. We're still waiting to hear who has the Powerball ticket worth $1 million from Wednesday's drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. The Circle S Food Store #2, located at 12222 FM 529 in Houston, sold a Quick Pick ticket matching all five numbers but not the Powerball for the Feb. 2 drawing. This is the first ticket in Texas to win a second-tier prize at the new $1 million prize level. The next Powerball drawing will be held Saturday, and players have until 9 p.m. Saturday to buy their tickets. If there are no grand/jackpot winning tickets for Saturday's drawing, the estimated jackpot for Wednesday will increase to $250 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery® has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed nearly $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance.
