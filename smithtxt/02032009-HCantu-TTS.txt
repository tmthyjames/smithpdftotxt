MAN FROM CORPUS CHRISTI TWO-STEPS HIS WAY TO A $600,000 PRIZE FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®

(AUSTIN) ­ While others were enjoying a certain football game on Sunday, Corpus Christi resident Henry Cantu discovered his own reason to celebrate. His Texas Two Step® ticket for the January 29 drawing matched all four numbers (4 ­ 25 ­ 26 ­ 27) and the Bonus Ball (29), for a jackpot prize of $600,000. "I saw on the billboard that someone had won because the prize was $200,000," explained Cantu. "I asked my friend to get the print-out of the numbers for me. That's when I saw that I got all of them." Cantu estimates that he's played Texas Two Step for at least three years, and each of his numbers holds a special meaning for him.

"It's no surprise that Texas Two Step has a loyal following among players like Mr. Cantu," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "The game offers overall odds of one in 32 and a $5 prize for matching only the Bonus Ball number." Already planning to retire later this year, Cantu knows how he'll use the money. "It's always been our dream to build a home," he said. The Texas Star #102, 1902 Baldwin Blvd. in Corpus Christi, is eligible for a $6,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $15 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $60 million.
