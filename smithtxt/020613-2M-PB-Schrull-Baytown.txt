$2 MILLION POWERBALL® WINNER FROM SOUTHEAST TEXAS KNOWS IT PAYS TO POWER PLAY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Gregory Schrull of Baytown and three friends traveled to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim a $2 million second-tier prize from the Powerball® drawing held Feb. 2. The winning Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (11 ­ 16 ­ 33 ­ 40 ­ 41) but not the Powerball (34). Because the Power Play® option was selected, the $1 million prize automatically doubled to $2 million. "Six of us have been playing together for about a year. Two of the guys couldn't make it today, but we hope we can bring them next time, when we win the $208 million," Schrull said in reference to tonight's Powerball drawing. This winning ticket was purchased at the Kroger #265, located at 4533 Garth Road in Baytown. The claimant did not provide a publicity photograph.
