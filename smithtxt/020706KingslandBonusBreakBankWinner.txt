$75,000 Bonus Break The Bank Prize Convinces Kingsland Player It Might Be Time To Commit
(AUSTIN) ­ Ricky Johnson of Kingsland has enjoyed playing Texas Lottery® scratch-off games for a long time now, but he never had a particular favorite. That all changed Sunday night when the $5 Bonus Break the Bank ticket he purchased turned out to be good for the game's top prize ­ $75,000! "I've always just kind of randomly picked my scratch-offs before," said Johnson. "After this though, I may stick with Bonus Break the Bank for a while!" The most Johnson had ever won playing the lottery before was $100. Johnson said he plans to use his Bonus Break the Bank winnings to open a savings account and take a vacation with his wife, who is scheduled to return from a oneyear contracting job in Kuwait later this month. "There's no sure-fire formula for winning, but with dozens of scratch-off games for our players to choose from, sometimes it is a good idea to play the field like Mr. Johnson did," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "But, as always, we want to remind all of our players that it only takes one ticket to win, so play responsibly!" In addition to the top prizes of $75,000, the Bonus Break the Bank game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $7,500. Johnson purchased his ticket at the Speedy Stop #202 located at 3208 Hwy. 71 in Del Valle.
