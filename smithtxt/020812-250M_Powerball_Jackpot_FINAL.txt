POWERBALL® JACKPOT CLIMBS TO $250 MILLION
Lucky Texan wins $1 million second-tier prize (AUSTIN) ­ With no tickets matching all five numbers and the Powerball number from Saturday's drawing, Texans now have an opportunity to play for tonight's Powerball® jackpot worth a quarter-billion dollars. This is the highest advertised jackpot since June 2010 when the estimated grand/jackpot prize reached $260 million, and it offers the sixth highest cash value in Powerball history, $156 million.

"Texans are excited about this jackpot and large cash prize," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is what Powerball is all about- bigger jackpots, better odds and more chances to win $1 million."

Ronald E. Wolfe of Houston was made a millionaire when he matched the first five numbers in last Wednesday's drawing and won Powerball's second-tier prize of $1 million. Wolfe purchased his winning ticket at the Circle S Food Store #2 located at12222 FM 529 in Houston. The Texas Lottery® set a new record last week with its highest sales for Powerball and Power Play®. For the week ending Feb. 4, Powerball sales were $6,186,774, and Power Play sales were $672,146, for a combined total of $6,858,920. The previous record for Texas Lottery Powerball sales in a single week was set during the run up to the Oct. 29, 2011 drawing when the estimated grand/jackpot prizes were $173 million and $203 million. That week generated a total sale of $5,798,561 for Powerball and Power Play.
