AND THE $8 BILLION TEXAS LOTTERY® WINNER IS... TEXAS EDUCATION
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery® supports Texas education through the transfer of lottery proceeds to the state's Foundation School Fund. Last week, the cumulative amount of those transfers topped the $8 billion mark. As of February 3, 2006, the exact amount sent from the Texas Lottery to the Foundation School Fund stood at $8,034,186,919. "The role of this agency is to generate revenue to support education in our state and I believe this $8 billion milestone is clear evidence of how well our agency is fulfilling that role," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We're committed to ensuring that the biggest Texas Lottery winner of all will continue to be Texas education." The Foundation School Fund, administered by the Texas Education Agency, assists public education in Texas at the local level by contributing to teacher salaries, administration and educational resources. The $8 billion transferred to this fund is the biggest part of the more than $13 billion in revenue the Texas Lottery has generated for Texas since the first lottery ticket was sold in May 1992. Lottery revenues have gone to the Foundation School Fund since September 1, 1997, as directed by the state legislature. Prior to that date, they were allocated to the General Revenue Fund.
