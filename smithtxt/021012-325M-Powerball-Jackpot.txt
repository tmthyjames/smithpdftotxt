POWERBALL® JACKPOT RAISED TO $325 MILLION HIGHEST CASH JACKPOT IN POWERBALL HISTORY
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas Lottery® players who enjoy the Powerball® game will have a chance to play for the largest jackpot offered since Texas joined the game in January 2010. Brisk sales pushed Saturday's jackpot beyond the original $310 million estimate to an estimated $325 million. The cash value jackpot is at a record $202.9 million, the highest ever for Powerball.

"We are excited to offer our players this chance to participate in a record-setting Powerball drawing," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Players respond to large jackpots, and this is the biggest Powerball jackpot that Texans have had an opportunity to win."

Powerball has grown into one of the world's biggest and most recognizable lottery games. Today Powerball is played in 44 lottery jurisdictions across the nation, raising nearly $1 billion each year for worthy causes.

The newly revamped $2 version of the game, which debuted January 15, was designed to give players more lottery game options by creating a premium Powerball with very large jackpots, a second prize of $1 million in cash, and better overall odds of winning a prize. Key features for the new game are starting jackpots that doubled from $20 million to $40 million and a cash second prize that quintupled from $200,000 to $1 million. One goal of the game change was to spread the wealth by offering a shower of $1 million prizes, and the game has already created 21 millionaires nationwide since the change.

By changing the number of red Powerballs from 39 to 35, the overall odds of winning a prize in Powerball improved from 1 in 35.1 to 1 in 31.8. The jackpot odds dropped from 1 in 195 million (more)

to 1 in 175 million. The odds of winning by matching just the red Powerball dropped from 1 in 61.7 to 1 in 55.4. With the game changes, the prize for matching the red Powerball number alone also increased to $4. The Power Play® option is still available for an extra $1 per play. Rather than randomly multiplying prizes by two to five times, Power Play now moves each prize level below the jackpot up by a set amount. The second-tier prize of $1 million is doubled to $2 million, and the $10,000 prize quadruples to $40,000. Other non-jackpot prizes are also increased.

"As the Powerball jackpot continues to grow, we encourage our players to have fun, enjoy the game and play responsibly," said Grief.

Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed nearly $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance.

Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions®, Lotto Texas®, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
