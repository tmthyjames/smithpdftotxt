FRIENDSWOOD RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION AFTER SELECTING MEGA MILLIONS® MEGAPLIER® FEATURE
(AUSTIN) ­ Friendswood resident Vance Murphy didn't need a jackpot win to claim a $1 million prize from the Texas Lottery®. All he needed was the power of the Mega Millions® Megaplier®. By choosing to spend an extra dollar on the add-on feature, Murphy was able to quadruple his $250,000 prize. Murphy matched the five Mega Millions numbers drawn on January 23, 2 ­ 17 ­ 20 ­ 27 ­ 28, but he missed the Mega Ball, 7. "Texas players have a unique opportunity to increase their nonjackpot Mega Millions prizes," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "By Megaplying, those winnings can multiply by two, three or even four times, as was the case for Mr. Murphy." The Value Discount Liquor located at 572 El Dorado Blvd. in Houston sold this winning ticket. Murphy requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $17 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
