FOOTBALL LEGENDS' JERSEY NUMBERS SCORE $1 MILLION WIN FOR KYLE MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER
(AUSTIN) ­ James C Smith Jr of Kyle scored a $1 million win playing Mega Millions® using the jersey numbers of Dallas Cowboys football legends Roger Staubach (12), Bob Hayes (22), Duane Thomas (33), Cliff Harris (43) and Robert Newhouse (44). The drawing occurred January 18. "I chose Troy's number, eight, for the Mega Ball, but the number 15 was drawn, so I didn't score really big on this win," Smith said. "You've got to have a reason to pick your numbers, and mine's as good as any, I think." "The reasons our players choose their numbers are as varied as the players themselves, as Mr. Smith has shown us," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This was a new one. In all the years of hearing about how players selected the numbers they played, I don't believe the choice of jersey numbers of legendary football players has ever been cited." Smith says he and his family will use the money for a family trip and to plan for retirement. "I kept the ticket at home, in a safe in the closet," Smith says. "And in case you're wondering, no, the safe wasn't shaped like a football." Smith requested minimal publicity.
