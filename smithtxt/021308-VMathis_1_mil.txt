SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER WINS AND WINS AND THEN WINS BIG
(AUSTIN) ­ Winning isn't new to Victor G. Mathis of Gonzales; he's claimed Texas Lottery® prizes of up to $20,000 in the past. He says he even won twice in one week a while back, but all that pales when compared to his latest win of $1 million in the $130 Million Payout Bonanza. Mathis enjoys playing scratch-off tickets and does so on a regular basis. In fact, he's such a good customer of the Jones Food Mart #1 that the employees take extra care of him. "They've got a special table set up for me," he says. "They've talked about getting me a recliner." Even more impressive, Mathis credits their customer service with aiding his latest win.

display case but opened a new pack to accommodate their loyal customer. The first ticket from that new pack held the big prize. "Our retailers are an important part of the Texas Lottery team," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We have some of the best retailers in the business, and as Mr. Mathis can attest, they understand the importance of taking care of our customers." At least one friend of the new winner hopes his good luck could rub off, literally. "I need you to come rub my head," he told Mathis. Mathis joked, "I've been rubbing heads all day, at $50 a head." While he doesn't guarantee his service will help anyone win the lottery, at least he'll have something he can fall back on if being a millionaire doesn't work out. Four $1 million prizes and two $5 million prizes remain unclaimed in the $130 Million Payout Bonanza scratch off. For selling this second-tier winning ticket, the Jones Food Mart #1 located at 1817 St. Joseph St. in Gonzales is eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $179 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $23 million.
