AMARILLO MAN TO ATTEND DALLAS COWBOYS GAMES THANKS TO SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Amarillo resident Russell A. Wells will get to spend some time in Dallas next year. He won a pair of season tickets in a recent Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing, and he will receive two seats between the 30-yard lines for every home game next season. "I'm excited," said Wells. "I plan on going to all of the Dallas Cowboys' home games." Wells has one piece of advice for other Texas Lottery® players. "Keep sending in your tickets for the second-chance drawings!" With more than $39 million in instant-win prizes, the Dallas Cowboys game features overall odds of winning any instant prize of one in 3.47, including break-even prizes. Five top-prizes of $250,000 and eight second-tier prizes of $5,000 remain unclaimed. The date for the last secondchance drawing will be assigned after the end of game date is determined. "Many of our players enjoy the Dallas Cowboys game because it offers another chance to win," explained Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The second-chance prizes include gift cards, autographed jerseys, and, of course, season tickets." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $40 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $101 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $24 million.
