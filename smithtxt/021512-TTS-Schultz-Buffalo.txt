BUFFALO PLAYER CLAIMS $200,000

TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ Reevis A. Schultz of Buffalo visited Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin Tuesday to claim a $200,000 Texas Two Step® jackpot prize. Schultz's ticket matched all five numbers (4 ­ 12 ­ 24 ­ 34) and the Bonus Ball (20) drawn on Feb. 13. Schultz, a longtime Texas Lottery player, said he planned to use his winnings for medical bills, home repairs and to help out his children and grandchildren. He also had a bit of advice for his fellow lottery players--Keep trying and don't give up! Schultz purchased his ticket at the Tigermart of Buffalo located at 2430 W. Commerce St. in Buffalo. The retailer is eligible to receive a $2,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. Mr. Schultz is correct, you can't win if you don't play, said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. As always though, we want to remind all of our players to play responsibly and remember that it only takes one ticket to win. Texas Two Step drawings are held on Mondays and Thursdays at 10:12 p.m. CST. Rolling jackpots start at $200,000 and are paid in one lump-sum payment. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $61 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $50 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million. (more)
