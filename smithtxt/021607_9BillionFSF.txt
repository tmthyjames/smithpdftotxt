TEXAS LOTTERY® MARKS ANOTHER MILESTONE; TOTAL TRANSFERS TO FOUNDATION SCHOOL FUND SURPASS $9 BILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ With this month's transfer of more than $79 million, proceeds to public education from the sale of Texas Lottery® tickets have surpassed the $9 billion mark. "Thanks to our 16,000 hard-working retailers and to our loyal players who continue to enjoy the fun and excitement of the Games of Texas, we've reached a new high-point in our mandate to generate funds for public education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "The exact amount transferred to the Foundation School Fund now stands at $9,051,351,808." Prior to September 1, 1997, Lottery proceeds were transferred to the General Revenue Fund. The total transfers to the state from Lottery proceeds since the first ticket was sold in May of 1992 come to $14.39 billion. Lottery winners have taken home more than $25.83 billion since the Games of Texas went on sale.
