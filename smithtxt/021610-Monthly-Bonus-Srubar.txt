SCHULENBURG RESIDENT WINS $2.4 MILLION MONTHLY BONUS PRIZE; NOTED RETAIL OUTLET SELLS SECOND BIG-PRIZE TICKET
(Austin) ­ William E. Srubar of Schulenburg said it had not hit him yet that he won the top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years in Monthly Bonus, a Texas Lottery® scratchoff ticket. The difference between the time he bought the ticket and the time he got to Lottery headquarters in Austin was only a few hours.

"But I didn't have a bad day," Srubar said. "I bought the ticket at 10 o'clock in the morning and got to the Lottery as fast as I could with a friend."

On the way over, Srubar got "dozens" of phone calls, he said, from well-wishers and friends in Schulenburg, where he is well-known as a part-time police officer. He also owns a 25 percent interest in a local business, and raises cattle when he has a few minutes to spare.

"When I bought the ticket, the guys at Leo's told me I turned red after I scratched the ticket," he said. "I told the clerk that I thought I had won the big one, $10,000. He thought that was a pretty good prize, but I had to correct him and tell him it was $10,000 per month for 20 years. Well, then all the other guys in the store had to look at the ticket."

Srubar was in Leo's Stop-N-Shop, known for being the retail outlet that sold the first-ever Lotto Texas® jackpot to be claimed. The store, located at 1306 Lyons Avenue, sold a $21.7 million Lotto Texas ticket claimed by another Schulenburg resident, Janie Kallus.
