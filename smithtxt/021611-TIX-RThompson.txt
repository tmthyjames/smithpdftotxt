VICTORIA RESIDENT'S THIRD WIN IS A CHARM
(Austin) ­This week, Victoria resident Richard N. Thompson claimed his third second-chance prize in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game Dallas Cowboys. He won an authentic signed Dallas Cowboys jersey in the first drawing and a $100 Dallas Cowboys gift card in the third drawing. In the most recent drawing, his name came up for his most exciting prize yet, a pair of season tickets between the 30-yard lines for every Dallas Cowboys home game next season. "I'm a fan, and I have been my whole life," said Thompson, but that is not the only reason he likes the Dallas Cowboys scratchoff. "This is a good game. I like it because you can send in your tickets for another chance if you don't win." Other second-chance prizes include a "Wild Weekend" package for up to 20 people and a "Draft Party Trip" for two. "Many of our players tell us the second-chance prizes attracted them to this game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's no surprise a Cowboys fan, like Mr. Thompson, would look forward to these fun and exciting Dallas Cowboys prizes." Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $52 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $126 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $25 million.
