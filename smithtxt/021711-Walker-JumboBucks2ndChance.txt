GARDEN RIDGE WOMAN $500,000 PRIZE IN GIANT JUMBO BUCKS III SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Sheridan J. Walker of Garden Ridge says she isn't much of a Texas Lottery® player, buying scratch-offs infrequently and the weekly Lotto Texas® ticket only because her 94-year-old mother insists on it. In fact, Walker's mother answered the phone when a lottery official called to inform her that she won a prize of $500,000 in a Giant Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawing. "At first, I thought someone was playing a joke on me, maybe even my mother," she said. "I started crying right after I got the news, and every time I think about it, I start all over again." Her mother, on the other hand, happily got on the phone, called her son and her great-grandson with the news, and reminded everyone that she herself had won $1,000 in another Texas Lottery second-chance drawing last August. "The second-chance drawings are a key factor in the continuing popularity of the Giant Jumbo Bucks III scratch-off game among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "By mailing in their non-winning tickets, players have the chance to win the top prize of $500,000, as Ms. Walker did, or one of 50 prizes of $1,000." Walker says she will pay off the mortgage with the prize and help her brother, too. "You can win, and I know it now, too," she said. "It's a good idea to visualize yourself winning a significant prize, but always remember to be grateful every day for what you already have." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $52 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $25 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $126 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
