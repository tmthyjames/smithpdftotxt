WACO WOMAN WINS $35,000 TOP PRIZE IN TEXAS LOTTERY® GAME, BONUS CASHWORD
(AUSTIN) ­ Bacilia Jasso of Waco has played Texas Lottery® games for some time now, always hoping that she would win a significant prize. Last Friday, her wish came true after she bought a Bonus Cashword ticket. "Last Friday I went to a Shell and bought one Bonus Cashword ticket," Jasso said. "I've always had the hope that I would win, and now that I have, I can't even say how happy I am. Luck turned my way last Friday." This version of Bonus Cashword was issued in November of 2008. "Bonus Cashword is a $3 game that offers 53 top prizes of $35,000," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Ms. Jasso's prize is the sixteenth of those to be claimed." Jasso bought her ticket at the H & M Kwik Stop, 1701 J. H. Kultgen Expressway, in Waco. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $103 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $20 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
