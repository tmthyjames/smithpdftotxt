$1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE CLAIMED BY OKLAHOMA RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Johnny B. Speers of Durant, Okla., claimed a $1 million prize last week from the Mega Millions® drawing held Feb. 10. Speers' ticket matched all five numbers (3­4­18­29­50) but not the Mega Ball (20). This qualified him for the second-tier prize worth $250,000, but since he selected the Megaplier® option, the prize was automatically increased to $1 million. Speers purchased his winning ticket at Dave's Ski & Tackle located at 4411 U.S. Route 75 N. in Denison. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $72 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $60 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $5 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery® has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed nearly $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
