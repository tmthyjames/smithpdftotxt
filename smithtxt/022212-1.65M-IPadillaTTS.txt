TEXAS TWO STEP® PLAYER SCOOTS DOWN
TO AUSTIN FOR $1.65 MILLION PRIZE CLAIM
(AUSTIN) ­ One Richardson resident may be dancing for joy. Ismael Padilla made his way to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin yesterday to claim a $1.65 million Texas Two Step® prize. He plans to keep working and promises his win will have little effect on his personality. "I'll be the same. The money is not going to change who I am. It could be $1 or $1 million or $100 million. It doesn't matter. I'm not going to change." Padilla correctly selected all four numbers, 4 ­ 6 ­ 18 ­ 33, and the Bonus Ball, 4, drawn Feb. 2. "This is the largest Texas Two Step jackpot we've seen in nearly two years," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "In addition to Mr. Padilla's lucky ticket, 22 players won prizes of $1,566 each." The Tetco #638, 14040 Montfort in Dallas, is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Tonight's Powerball ® jackpot is an estimated $60 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $5 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $83 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed nearly $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
