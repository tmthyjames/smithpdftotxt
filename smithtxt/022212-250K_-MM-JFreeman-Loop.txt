$250,000 MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE LANDS LOOP LOTTERY PLAYER TOP SPOT IN HOUSEHOLD WINNINGS RACE
(AUSTIN) ­ Joe C. Freeman of Loop, Texas, claimed a $250,000 second-tier Mega Millions® prize yesterday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Lubbock. Joe became the second member of the Freeman family to claim a large Texas Lottery prize recently--his wife claimed a $10,000 prize just a couple of weeks ago. Mr. Freeman's ticket matched all five numbers (16­25­28­32­40), but not the Mega Ball (3) in the drawing held Feb. 17. I was still pretty excited about the $10,000 my wife won, said Mr. Freeman. Now, I've just been numb since Saturday morning when she woke me up to tell me she'd checked the numbers. Mr. Freeman said he plans to use his winnings to buy a house for his wife and invest the rest so that he can retire earlier than he'd planned. It's certainly been an exciting and profitable couple of weeks for the Freeman family, said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. We never know when or where Texas Lottery luck will strike, but we do know you can't win if you don't play. Mr. Freeman purchased his winning ticket at Allsup's #178 located at 1107 Railroad Ave. in Seagraves. (more)
