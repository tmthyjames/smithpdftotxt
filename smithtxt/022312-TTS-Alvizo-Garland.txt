GARLAND TEXAS TWO STEP® PLAYER PICKS UP $225,000 PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Juan Alvizo of Garland claimed a $225,000 Texas Two Step® jackpot at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Dallas on Wednesday. Alvizo's ticket matched all five numbers (3 ­ 7 ­ 16 ­ 33) and the Bonus Ball (17) drawn on Feb. 20. Alvizo said that he likes the simplicity of Texas Two Step and that he usually buys one or two tickets for each drawing. Alvizo plans to use some of his winnings to pay off bills and put the rest in savings. Alvizo discovered his good fortune when he checked the winning numbers on the Texas Lottery website, "I couldn't believe it when I read the numbers and saw that they matched mine," he said. "This really comes at a good time." Alvizo purchased his ticket at the RaceTrac #183 located at 1355 State Highway 66 in Garland. The retailer is eligible to receive a $2,250 bonus for selling the winning ticket. "Texas Two Step has been around for more than a decade now," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "With overall odds of one in 32 and a $5 prize just for matching the Bonus Ball, it's easy to see why it remains a favorite of many players like Mr. Alvizo." Texas Two Step drawings are held on Mondays and Thursdays at 10:12 p.m. CST. Rolling jackpots start at $200,000 and are paid in one lump-sum payment. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $83 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $70 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $6 million. (more)
