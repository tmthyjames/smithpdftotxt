TEXAS LOTTERY® POWERBALL® PLAYER FROM BELTON WINS $2 MILLION WITH POWER PLAY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Carol Ann Byron of Belton claimed a $2 million Powerball® prize thanks to the optional addon feature, Power Play®. Byron's Quick Pick ticket matched all of the numbers drawn (2-9-14-21-23) but not the Powerball (3) for the drawing held Feb. 15. Normally, this would qualify her for a $1 million prize, but because she selected the Power Play option at the time of purchase, her prize increased to $2 million. Byron purchased her winning ticket at the H-E-B Food Store #561 located at 407 S. Adam St. in Fredericksburg. Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Wednesday's jackpot is an estimated $50 million. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play. The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510.
