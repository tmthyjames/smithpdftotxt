TEXAS LOTTERY® BLACK SCRATCH-OFF GAME SALES CONTINUE TO SOAR
(Austin) ­ Sales of Texas Lottery® Black, a $10 scratch-off game released in mid-January, continue their rocket pace, selling ahead of all other Texas Lottery® instant games for the sixth week in a row. "We issued this game at the $10 price point with $44.3 million in total prizes, six top prizes of $1 million and many significant second- and third-tier prizes of $10,000 and $5,000, believing it would be a hit among our players and a big seller for our retailers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It certainly has been, as sales indicate. Week over week since its release on January 17, Texas Lottery® Black sales have far out-paced sales of all our other scratch-off games through last week." The game has a print-run of 6,178,100 tickets, and each retailer pack has 50 tickets with a guaranteed total prize amount of $240 per pack. The game allows players to win up to 30 times. The odds of winning the top prize are one in 1 million. The overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.32, including break-even prizes. Two of the game's six top prizes have been claimed through the end of February. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
