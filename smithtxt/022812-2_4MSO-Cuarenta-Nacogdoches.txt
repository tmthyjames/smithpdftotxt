FINAL TOP PRIZE IN MONTHLY BONUS CLAIMED; NACOGDOCHES RESIDENT WINS $2.4 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ "It feels good, real good," said Lorenzo Cuarenta Jr. of Nacogdoches after winning $10,000 per month for 20 years in the Monthly Bonus (Game #1343) scratch-off game, a total of $2.4 million. Cuarenta bought one ticket at the University Drive Kwik Stop located at 1115 S. University Drive in Nacogdoches, but that ticket wasn't a winner. "I decided to go back and get another. I'd gotten paid, so I had an extra $5 to spare. I came out and scratched the second ticket. I got all the way to the bottom, to the second-to-last number. I thought I wasn't going to win. Then I saw that bill," said Cuarenta. This is the final top prize for the current version of Monthly Bonus, but a new version of the game is already available at Texas Lottery® retailers. With more than $52 million in total prizes, the new Monthly Bonus (Game #1437) features overall odds of winning any prize of one in 3.94, including break-even prizes. "Monthly Bonus continues to be a popular game among our players, and it's easy to see why. Winning the top prize is like winning once a month for the next 20 years," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. Cuarenta plans to buy a house with his prize money, but he's not the only one to benefit from his good fortune. Selling the winning Monthly Bonus ticket also makes the University Drive Kwik Stop eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus.
