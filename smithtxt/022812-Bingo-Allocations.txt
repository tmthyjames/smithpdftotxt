CHARITABLE BINGO ALLOCATIONS FOR 2011 4TH QUARTER ISSUED TO 145 JURISDICTIONS
(AUSTIN) ­ Charitable bingo activity in 145 jurisdictions across the state in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted in $3.1 million in allocations for those cities and counties. The Charitable Bingo Operations Division of the Texas Lottery® also sent more than $3.4 million to the state's General Revenue Fund. Total allocations of $6.5 million in the fourth quarter were down 1.2 percent from the previous quarter, but increased by 3.3 percent over the same period in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2010, total allocations were $6.3 million. Allocations are the result of prize fees collected from players who won bingo prizes in October, November and December in games conducted by nonprofit organizations. As required by law, 5 percent of a prize awarded is withheld from the winner and deposited in a non-dedicated account in the General Revenue Fund. Cities and counties that imposed the gross receipt tax on a local-option basis on or before Jan. 1, 1993, receive quarterly payments of up to 2.5 percent of the prizes won by bingo players in their jurisdictions.
