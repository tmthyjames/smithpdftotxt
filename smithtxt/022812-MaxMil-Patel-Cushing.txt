CUSHING RESIDENT WINS FIRST $1 MILLION TOP PRIZE IN MAXIMUM MILLIONS SCRATCH-OFF
(AUSTIN) ­ Viral Patel of Cushing claimed the first of four $1 million top prizes available in the Maximum Millions scratch-off game at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler yesterday. When asked how he felt about his big win, Patel responded, "Great. Stunned. Like a million bucks!" Patel plans to use his winnings to finish his education and will save the remainder for his future. "Since revenue generated from Texas Lottery sales supports public education in Texas, it's exciting to see Mr. Patel using his winnings to further his own education and plan for his future," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. Maximum Millions began on Jan. 30, 2012, and has three $1 million prizes and 12 prizes of $10,000 each remaining unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize in the game are one in 2.81, including break-even prizes. The winning ticket was purchased at the Cushing Food Mart located at 230 Cypress Ave. in Cushing, making the store eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $40 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $108 million. (more)
