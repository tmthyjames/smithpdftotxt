THIRD TICKET'S A CHARM FOR $2.5 MILLION SCRATCH-OFF WINNER FROM GRANBURY
(AUSTIN) ­ Dwight Cullum of Granbury didn't have much luck with the two scratch-off tickets he bought last Monday night, but that didn't stop him from going back for a third one on Tuesday morning. His perseverance paid off in a big way and by Friday, Cullum found himself at Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim the second of 10 $2.5 million top prizes in the $500,000,000 Extreme Cash Blast game. Cullum knew he had a winner early on Tuesday; he just didn't realize quite how much. "I scratched it part way off and thought I'd won my money back," said Cullum. "I was going to go into another store across the street to trade it in for another ticket." Cullum decided he'd better finish scratching the ticket before he took it in and that's when he realized he'd done a lot better than breaking even. "I looked at it once and then I looked at it twice and I thought to myself, well, ok," Cullum recalled. "Then I took it into the store and asked the clerk to look and see if he saw what I was seeing. He looked at it and his jaw just dropped." Still a little in shock over his new-found fortune, Cullum then decided to call his wife to share the news. "Well, she called me a liar at first, but then she started giggling when I promised her it was for real." Cullum says he and his wife plan to invest most of the money. He's not planning to retire right away, but says he might cut back on work some. "I still enjoy working, but I think it might be kind of nice to just hang out and do whatever I want to do a little more," said Cullum.
