CHARITABLE BINGO PROCEEDS SURPASS $800 MILLION TO TEXAS NON-PROFITS
(AUSTIN) ­ As a result of conducting charitable bingo games, non-profit organizations across Texas can celebrate another milestone; reaching $800 million in proceeds from the conduct of games since 1982. "This indeed marks another milestone for charitable bingo in Texas," said Billy Atkins, director of the charitable bingo division at the Texas Lottery Commission. "Proceeds from charitable bingo games benefit real people, not just an organization or a group. The non-profits use the proceeds to make life better for people from all walks of life, including veterans, community groups, the needy, the disabled and even our friends in the animal kingdom." Bingo games as they are played today aren't your grandmother's old game anymore. Decades ago, bingo was played with small piece of paper and kernels of corn that players would put on the paper. "Now games are played with pull-tabs as well as card minding devices, which are electronic devices that allow players to play up to 66 cards at the same time. So, bingo has made the jump to the 21st Century," Atkins said. There are 1,265 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes.
