MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT BUMPED TO $275 FOR TONIGHT'S DRAW; $48 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT UP FOR SATURDAY'S DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ The Mega Millions® jackpot for tonight's drawing has been bumped to $275 million, up $8 million from the previously-advertised amount of $267 million. "Texas Lottery players across the state can look forward to a new Mega Millions jackpot of $275 million, as well as a $48 million jackpot in Lotto Texas for tomorrow night's draw," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Sales of Mega Millions tickets are brisk enough across the 12 participating states that bumping the jackpot was something that could happen today. This game has not been above $200 million since April of 2006 when it crested at $265 million. Lotto also has not been this high since we changed the matrix back in April of last year. As exciting as these jackpot amounts are for our players, we always want to remind them to play responsibly. It takes only one ticket to win." Sales of both games reach their high point on the respective days of their drawings, Sadberry said. Ticket sales are particularly brisk during the lunch hour and at drive time on weekdays. On Saturdays, sales climb steadily all day. At 11 a.m. today, Mega Millions tickets were selling at a rate of 2,731 per minute.

If there are no winners in tonight's drawing, the jackpot will climb to $340 million for Tuesday's drawing. That would be the highest jackpot offered by Mega Millions under its current name. When the current game operated under the name of The Big Game, the jackpot reached a high of $363 million. The last Mega Millions jackpot-winning ticket was sold in Amarillo. The Crump, Allen & Lewis General Partnership of Amarillo claimed the Cash Value Option jackpot of $73.5 million. The drawing was on January 9 and the jackpot has been climbing since then.
