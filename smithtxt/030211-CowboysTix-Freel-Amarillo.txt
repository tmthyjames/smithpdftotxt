TEXAS LOTTERY® SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING BRINGS AMARILLO MAN DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS
(Austin) ­Stanley J. Freel of Amarillo won a pair of Dallas Cowboys 2011 season tickets after sending in his non-winning Dallas Cowboys scratch-off tickets to a second-chance Texas Lottery® drawing. Freel said his wife was at home one morning and saw his name on a list of winners on the Texas Lottery website. "I couldn't believe it when she called me at work and gave me the news. It made me feel great." Though the distance from Amarillo to the Arlington area is approximately a daunting 352 miles by car, Freel remains committed. "I plan to see all the home games," he said. "It's no wonder that Mr. Freel is excited about seeing all the home games," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The pair of tickets he won will seat him and a companion right between the 30-yard lines." Freel said he enters the lottery's second-chance drawings as often as possible because he keeps winning. "Last year I won a Tony Romo jersey, and this year I've won three $100 Dallas Cowboys gift cards and two Houston Texans jerseys. So, yes, I really like the second-chance drawings and I love football." The Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game offers players more than $39.3 million in total instant-win prizes. The game was released August 2, 2010, with 12 top prizes of $250,000, five of which remain unclaimed. (more)
