DESOTO WOMAN ALMOST HAS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® TICKET MAILED OFF IN BIRTHDAY CARD
(AUSTIN) ­ Gwendolyn Chandler of DeSoto breathed a sigh of relief when her friend, Nancy, told her she had almost mailed off her Mega Millions® ticket worth $1 million in a birthday card to a mutual friend. "She told me she kept checking the two long envelopes sitting on the passenger side of the car to make sure she wasn't mailing my ticket away instead of the birthday card," Chandler said. "She was on her way to put the ticket in the safe deposit box at her bank, which is closer to my house. It's one of those things you think might be funny if it had been the ticket that was mailed and the card put in the bank, but, really, you shudder about it." Chandler was at Lottery headquarters in Austin today to collect her prize of $1 million that came with the ticket she purchased at the Dash-In Grocery, 2445 Goldfinch Lane in Garland. Her Quick Pick ticket had five of the numbers drawn on Tuesday, February 19, but not the Mega Ball. The prize for having five of the drawn numbers minus the Mega Ball is $250,000. Chandler bought the Megaplier feature and multiplied her prize by four, the Megaplier number for that night's drawing, to equal $1 million. Chandler, who is retired, said she has received numerous phone calls from old friends and colleagues congratulating her on her win. The winner requested minimal publicity.
