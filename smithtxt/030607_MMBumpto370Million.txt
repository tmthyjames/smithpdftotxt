MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT BUMPED TO RECORDBREAKING $370 MILLION FOR TONIGHT'S DRAWING, LARGEST JACKPOT EVER OFFERED IN NORTH AMERICA
(AUSTIN) ­ The Mega Millions® jackpot for tonight's drawing has been bumped to a record-breaking $370 million, and is the largest ever offered in North American lottery history, surpassing last year's Powerball top prize of $365 million. This jackpot also exceeds The Big Game's biggest jackpot of $363 million, which occurred in May of 2000. "Sales of Mega Millions tickets across the 12 participating states are redhot right now, as this is the biggest advertised jackpot of any kind in lottery history," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Even so, we still want to remind players in Texas that it takes only one ticket to win. We encourage everyone who is planning to buy a ticket to play responsibly. I would also include the caveat to drive carefully and be patient when buying tickets most especially today. We expect to get approximately 75 percent of total sales for this drawing today." Ticket sales are particularly brisk during the lunch hour and at drive time on weekdays. During the noon hour, Mega Millions tickets were selling at a rate of 9,261 per minute. If there are no winners in tonight's drawing, the jackpot will climb to a whopping $470 million for Friday's drawing.
