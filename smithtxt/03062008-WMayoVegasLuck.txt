SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT, TWO BITS? NEDERLAND MAN GETS $1 MILLION INSTEAD
(AUSTIN) ­ Willie E. Mayo of Nederland walked into his local barbershop to get a haircut Wednesday, but when he saw it would be a long wait, he decided to stop by the Fina Kwik Mart at 2924 Nederland Ave. instead. After all, he didn't want to be late picking up his daughter. "I decided to get a scratch-off ticket and a Coke," said Mayo. "Usually, I buy $5 or $10 tickets. I almost never buy a $25 one, but the lady at the store said she only had one of those left. I told her to go ahead and give it to me." Skipping his haircut allowed Mayo to pick up the last $1,000,000 Vegas Luck ticket at the counter, plus a little something extra. After walking outside the store, he scratched his way to a $1 million surprise.

"When I saw what I had, I nearly passed out," he said. He retrieved his daughter early from school. Although he explained his situation, the registrar didn't know whether to mark the absence as excused or unexcused. Then the principal came to his rescue saying, "The man just won a million dollars. It's excused." "We congratulate Mr. Mayo, the third person to claim $1 million in this game." said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "While only one more top prize remains, there are still a dozen $10,000 prizes up for grabs as of today." For his part, Mayo hasn't fully recovered from the shock of winning. "I never did get that Coke. I guess I don't need the caffeine when I have all this adrenaline," he said laughing. For selling the winning ticket, the Fina Kwik Mart in Nederland is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $37 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
