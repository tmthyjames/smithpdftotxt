TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF GAME $500 MILLION FRENZY ON SALE MONDAY

(Austin) ­ It was the top-selling instant ticket in Texas for 42 weeks. Total sales since its inception on May 18, 2009, exceed $451 million. In its first week of sales, it sold more than $6.5 million, and its best week topped $10.5 million. It's the $500 Million Blockbuster, and it's about to get some competition. The new spotlight game, $500 Million Frenzy, goes on sale March 7 at Texas Lottery® licensed retailers throughout the state. "The $500 Million Blockbuster was a remarkably successful game for us," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The `elephant game,' as many called it, created more millionaires than any other single-run scratch-off game in Texas Lottery history. Based on the success of that game, the agency will introduce a similar scratch-off called $500 Million Frenzy on Monday." The prize structure for the $500 Million Frenzy is similar to that of the $500 Million Blockbuster. The new game will feature more than half a billion dollars in total prizes, 50 prizes of $1 million or more, including 10 prizes of $2.5 million, and overall odds of one in 2.77, including break-even prizes.
