MEGA MILLIONS® SYSTEM ISSUES RESOLVED IN CALIFORNIA; TEXAS MEGA MILLIONS TICKETS CAN NOW BE CLAIMED
(AUSTIN) ­ The system problems experienced by the California Lottery that kept the remaining 11 states that participate in the Mega Millions® game on hold all morning have now been resolved, and validations in Texas can go forward. Players can also obtain winning-ticket print-outs. "Texas and 10 other state lotteries had to wait until California resolved its systems issues, and we're happy to say that we can now give our players the goahead to validate their Mega Millions tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We've kept our retailers apprised of the situation all morning through messages we've sent via their online terminals. We'd like to thank our retailers, as well as our players, for their patience as they persevered with us while we waited for another state to fix a problem that wound up affecting millions of players throughout the country." There were two jackpot-winning tickets that were sold for last night's record-breaking $370 million drawing. One was sold in Dalton, Georgia, and the other in Woodbine, New Jersey. The winning numbers were 16-22-29-39-42, and the Mega Ball was 20. The odds of hitting the jackpot are one in 176 million.
