VERNON RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION IN TEXAS LOTTERY® SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­Even before she knew it, Paula Bailey's friends in Vernon learned from the Texas Lottery® website that their pal won $1 million in the Mega Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawing. Her friends found her name on the winners' list. "I was at work," Bailey said. "Almost everyone I know knew about it before I did." Finding out from her friends about the win nearly knocked her over. "I'm a regular player and have been for years. I have used family birthdays on the online tickets and decided which scratch-offs to buy based on how many tickets are in a roll originally and how many remain. When my friends told me about this win, I got nervous and excited, but mostly I was shocked," Bailey said. The $1 million prize will be a savings boon for her family, Bailey said. "I'm saving most of this money for my children, but this will also help me get out of debt and buy a new vehicle." "Ms. Bailey's name was selected in the third and last of the scheduled second-chance drawings for the Jumbo Bucks III suite of games," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "One more drawing remains and will be conducted approximately two weeks after the End-of-Game date for each game is announced." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $127 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $30 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $40 million.
