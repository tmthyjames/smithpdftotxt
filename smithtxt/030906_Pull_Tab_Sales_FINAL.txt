SALES OF BINGO PULL-TABS RED-HOT ACROSS TEXAS IN 2005, POST LARGEST-EVER RECEIPTS
(AUSTIN) ­ Sales of pull-tabs, the instant tickets of charitable bingo, sizzled during 2005, bringing in a record $222,880,635, a 22 percent hike over 2004. "The Texas bingo industry has never seen players respond to a product as favorably as they have to event style pull-tabs," said Billy Atkins, director of the charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Players speak with their dollars, and what they're telling us is that they think pull-tabs are a fun way to play bingo because pull-tabs are exciting, fast to play, and players know immediately if they've won." In 2002 a new style of pull-tab game was approved for sale in Texas and those games have resulted in a dramatic increase in sales. From 2002 to 2003 sales of pull-tab tickets increased of 45 percent and sales have continued to increase every year since. Most of the 1,265 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes also sell pull-tabs.
