EVEN WITHOUT JACKPOT WINNER, TEXAS WINS BIG IN RECORD MEGA MILLIONS® DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ No tickets sold in Texas for the $370 million Mega Millions® drawing earlier this week matched all of the numbers drawn for the largest jackpot in the history of North American lotteries, but that doesn't mean that Texas and Texans weren't big winners. "Even though a Texas player didn't win the jackpot, the state, and Texas Lottery players and retailers still won big due to the money derived from sales, prizes and commissions," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. Texas Mega Millions sales for the roll cycle (beginning January 10, 2007) leading up to Tuesday's record jackpot totaled $47,933,642, and MegaplierTM sales totaled just under $9.5 million. Lower-tier prize payouts during the same roll cycle totaled $9,304,803, and Texas Lottery retailers collected $2,396,682 in sales commissions. "But of course, the biggest winner of all was Texas education, since sales for this record Mega Millions jackpot generated millions of dollars in revenue to support the state's Foundation School Fund," said Sadberry. After prize payouts, sales commissions and other expenses, approximately 41 percent of Mega Millions sales, and 48 percent of Megaplier sales, is transferred to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas.

(Texas Lottery Commission news release, continued)

The Texas Lottery has generated well over $14 billion for the state of Texas since the first ticket was sold in 1992. Prior to 1997, the proceeds were allocated to the General Revenue Fund. Since 1997, all Texas Lottery proceeds ­ totaling more than $9 billion ­ have been transferred to the Foundation School Fund, including more than $1 billion in fiscal year 2006. The numbers drawn in Tuesday's Mega Millions drawing were 16-22-2939-42, and the Mega Ball was 20. Seven tickets sold in Texas for Tuesday's drawing matched five of five numbers, good for $250,000 each. An additional 19 tickets matched four of five numbers plus the Mega Ball, good enough for $10,000 each. Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 56, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 46. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $12 million and increases until it is won. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 176 million. The overall odds of winning any prize are approximately 1 in 40. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times. For example, if a player Megaplies and the Megaplier number is 4, a second-tier (5 of 5 numbers) prize increases from $250,000 to $1 million. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $53 million.
