Attendance at bingo occasions exceeded 658 million since the game was legalized in 1981. "Overall, the attendance for 2010 was down from the same period in 2009, while we did see a slight increase in the number of occasions," Sanderson said. "The average attendance per bingo occasion is slightly down; however, the average amount spent per player did increase slightly over the previous year. Despite a slight decline in attendance, charitable bingo is still fun for players of all ages, especially long-time players who enjoy playing not only because the game is entertaining, but also because it gives them a chance to socialize with other long-faithful aficionados who feel the same way." During 2010, 1,181 non-profits conducted charitable bingo games. For more information about charitable bingo, please visit the official website, www.txbingo.org.
