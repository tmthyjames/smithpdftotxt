$1 MILLION POWERBALL® TICKET SOLD IN PEARLAND CLAIMED

(AUSTIN) ­ The Marchwon Trust, George H Robinson, Trustee, of Greensboro, N.C., claimed a Powerball® ticket worth $1 million from the drawing held Saturday, March 1. The Marchwon Trust's Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (3-8-25-30-47) but not the Powerball (13) for the second-tier prize. The ticket was sold at the Mr Express #3 located at 12705 Broadway St. in Pearland.

Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Wednesday's jackpot is an estimated $60 million. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play.
