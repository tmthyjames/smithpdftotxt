FIRST-TIME TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER WINS WITH WEEKLY HALF GRAND SCRATCH-OFF Winning ticket purchased in Houston
(AUSTIN) ­ Call it beginner's luck. Heidi Jo Love was on her first trip to Texas when an empty gas tank put her unexpectedly in a Texas Lottery® retailer, and she decided to try the Weekly Half Grand for the first time and won $520,000 before taxes.

Love purchased her winning ticket at the Westheimer & Chimney Rock Chevron located at 5660 Westheimer Road in Houston.

"I was in town for my niece's fourth birthday," said Love. "My dad and I like to play scratch-offs when we are out of town, and it was our first visit to Texas."

The serial number on the ticket seemed to match up with her niece's birthday, so she thinks the luck may have been in those numbers. Love is currently engaged to be married and may use some of her winnings to travel. "I'm going to save some, invest some and give back to some people a bit," she said.

The Weekly Half Grand is part of a suite of games based on the popular Weekly Grand scratchoff. Love won the last of four top prizes in this game. She will receive $500 per week for 20 years, or a total of $520,000, before taxes.
