MINERAL WELLS RESIDENT CLAIMS TOP PRIZE IN $1,000,000 MEGA BUCKS TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Sherri McGinnis of Mineral Wells has claimed the top prize in $1,000,000 Mega Bucks from the Texas Lottery®. The new winner said she kept the ticket on her person almost the entire time since she bought it. "I put it in an envelope that I had on me all the time, even when I was sleeping, or trying to," she said. "When I was in the shower, it was in a rolled-up envelope in my robe pocket where no one would have looked. It was always close to me." McGinnis bought the ticket at the Metro Discount Foods, located at 100 SE 17th Street in Mineral Wells. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold the ticket. This is the second of three top prizes in this game to be claimed. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $19 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $56 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
