FOR TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYERS, $200 MILLION

POWERBALL® JACKPOT MAY BE JUST THE TICKET
(Austin) ­ Texas Lottery® players this weekend will have the opportunity to play for a Powerball® jackpot worth $200 million, the highest it's been since Texas joined the multi-state game in January. The drawing is Saturday night. "This jackpot is noteworthy not only because of the $200 million prize, but also because this is precisely the kind of jackpot that we knew the game would generate for our players who have reminded us in the past that they enjoy playing for jackpots of this magnitude," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "The biggest winner, however, is the Foundation School Fund, which receives the proceeds generated by the sales of all our online games and supports public education in our state." Powerball sales began in Texas in late January, joining the popular Mega Millions® game which has been available in the state since 2003. Since Powerball began in February of 1988, and Mega Millions' inception in August of 1996, the games have generated more than $17.6 billion for good causes in the states where they are played, causes such as education, senior programs, local towns and the environment. Powerball is projected to generate $35 million per fiscal year in additional revenue for the Foundation School Fund. "As exciting as this $200 million jackpot is, we want to remind our players to play responsibly," Grief said. "After all, it takes only one ticket to win." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $59 million. ###
