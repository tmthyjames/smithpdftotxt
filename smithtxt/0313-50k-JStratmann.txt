$50,000 TOP PRIZE CLAIMED IN BINGO MULTI-PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ James R. Stratmann of Port O'Connor enjoys playing Texas Lottery® scratch-off games. During a recent trip to the Speedy Mart located at 1620 W. Adams in Port O'Connor, he purchased one of his favorite tickets, the Bingo Multi-Prize. Then he scratched his way to a $50,000 top prize. "I'm going to buy a new set of wheels. I've been driving my current car since '94," said Stratmann. Four top prizes of $50,000 each and 11 second-tier prizes of $20,000 currently remain unclaimed in the Bingo Multi-Prize game. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.53, including break-even prizes. There are more than $52 million in total prizes for this game. Other scratch-off games with similar themes include $250,000 Bingo and Casino Bingo. Stratmann offered a bit of advice for other Texas Lottery players, saying, "Don't give up ­ keep playing. You never know when it's going to be your time to win." Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance.
