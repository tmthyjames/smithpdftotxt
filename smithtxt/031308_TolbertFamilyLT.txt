TOLBERT FAMILY TRUST CLAIMS SHARE OF $28 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­The Tolbert Family Trust, Bobby Joe Tolbert, Trustee, of Houston, has claimed one half of the $28 million Lotto Texas® jackpot for the drawing on February 23. The prize amount is $14.3 million before taxes and will be paid out through the annuity option. This means the Tolbert Family Trust will receive 25 annual payments of $560,000 beginning with an initial payment of $883,430.98. "I first thought my Lotto numbers were a computer misprint, so I didn't get excited," Bobby Tolbert said. "After I found out it was true, I gave thanks to the good Lord, over and over again for His blessings." Tolbert said the trust will tithe to the church and then share the winnings with family. "Mr. Tolbert has put his faith and his family first in consideration of how to manage this prize, which is a great start on the long-term handling of this $14 million-plus jackpot," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "The other half of the February 23 Lotto $28 million jackpot has already been claimed by JM Hale, LP, of Addison. That ticket also was purchased with the annuity option, and, like the Tolbert Trust's ticket, it also was a Quick Pick." The numbers drawn were 2 - 7 - 21 ­ 35 - 43 - 50.
