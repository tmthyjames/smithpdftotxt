OCTOBER 2, 2006, TEXAS TWO STEP® $1 MILLION-PLUS PRIZE STILL UNCLAIMED; TICKET SOLD IN BRYAN EXPIRES SOON
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery® is still waiting for the player with the Texas Two Step® ticket worth $1,075,000 to come in and claim the prize. "We are two weeks away from seeing this ticket expire," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "March 31 is the expiration date for this ticket, and we urge everyone in the Bryan area who plays Texas Two Step to look for it in their homes and vehicles. If someone finds a ticket among their possessions that they believe to be the one in question, and it's been through the wash, bring it in; we have the equipment to determine if it indeed is the ticket that matched the numbers drawn for that night." The ticket was purchased at the Exxon Express Market, 505 N. Harvey Mitchell Parkway in Bryan. The numbers drawn were 2 - 10 - 13 - 24, and the bonus ball was 7. If the prize remains unclaimed, the money goes into the Unclaimed Prize Fund, which gives up to $10 million annually to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) through the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. The rest goes to the General Revenue Fund, as legislatively mandated. In Fiscal Year 2007, which began September 1, 2006, the Unclaimed Prize Fund has received $31,087,886 through February.
