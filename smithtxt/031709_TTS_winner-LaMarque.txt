CRYSTAL BEACH RESIDENT TAKES THE LONG WAY TO AUSTIN TO CLAIM THURSDAY'S $2.15 MILLION TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ Thomas L Raborn of Crystal Beach was on his way to Ardmore, Oklahoma, to pick up some friends and bring them to Texas to enjoy spring break on the coast when he found out he'd won last Thursday's $2,150,000 Texas Two Step® jackpot. "I bought my tickets in LaMarque before I left in the morning at 3:30 to head to Oklahoma," Raborn said. "I was in Jacksonville when I got a printout of the winning numbers. That was about 8:30. I didn't have to look twice at the ticket to know that it had the winning numbers." After pulling over to sign his ticket, Raborn called his son, who gave him directions on how to get to Austin from where he was. He arrived at Texas Lottery® headquarters just after the noon hour. "When I bought the tickets, the combination of Quick Picks and selfselected that I got, the clerk at the Shell blew on them and said, `the winner's in here,'" Raborn said. "He was right." The new winner said he enjoys playing Texas Lottery games and has been doing so for many years. "I told my family I was going to win one day," he said. "I have a system that I use that includes the number nine, which turned out to be the bonus ball number last night."
