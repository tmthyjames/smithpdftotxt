If there are no jackpot winners for tonight's drawing, the jackpot for Friday's drawing will be an estimated $490 million.

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.

Texas joined the Mega Millions game in 2003 and the state has had 10 Mega Millions jackpot prize winners.
