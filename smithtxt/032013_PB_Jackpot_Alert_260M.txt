JACKPOT ALERT: TONIGHT'S POWERBALL® JACKPOT AT $260 MILLION

(AUSTIN) ­ Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $260 million, the largest lottery jackpot currently up for grabs in the U.S. This jackpot started as a $40 million prize on Feb. 9, and is the result of 11 draws without a jackpot winner. The largest Powerball jackpot ever and the second largest jackpot in history for any lottery game was an advertised $550 million for the drawing held on Nov. 28 of last year. Powerball players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 59, plus the Powerball number from a field of 35. The second-tier prize, awarded for matching all five numbers, but not the Powerball number is $1 million. Players can increase their second-tier prize to $2 million if they purchase the $1 add-on feature Power Play with their ticket. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 32.
