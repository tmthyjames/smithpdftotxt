EULESS RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PRIZE PLAYING DEAL OR NO DEAL FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­As father-son traditions go, Jose Luis Chavana Jr., and his father have a good one going, one that has brought the younger Chavana a prize of $1 million from the Texas Lottery®. "Every time we go to the grocery store, we always buy three Lottery tickets, either from the vending machine or the clerk at the counter," Chavana said. "In February, my dad bought three Deal Or No Deal tickets when we were at the store. Like we always do, we scratched them as we walked out of the store to see who got what." When he saw the prize on his ticket, Chavana said it didn't seem real. "I told myself that prize of $1 million that I was looking at just wasn't real," he said. "It turned out to be very real. I made sure that I kept the ticket with me at all times. It's been in my briefcase, which I always have." Chavana says he hasn't made concrete plans about what he's going to do with his prize, except to pay his bills. "Maybe I'll buy a house," he said. "I've thought about it, but I decided I wasn't going to make any big decisions until I know I've got the prize money." Chavana's father purchased the ticket at Fiesta Mart #11, located at 4711 Airline in Houston. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this top-prize-winning ticket.

"It's always a good thing to be prudent about how to spend a significant Lottery prize, and Mr. Chavana is wise not to spend the money before it's in hand," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "After today, Deal Or No Deal will have one top prize of $1 million left to be claimed, as well as other prizes ranging from $100,000 and $50,000 down to the break-even prize of $5." This was not the Chavana family's first experience with Deal Or No Deal. On Christmas Eve, the elder Chavana won $50,000 also playing this game. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $83 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $11 million.
