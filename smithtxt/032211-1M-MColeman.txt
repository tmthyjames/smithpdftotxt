$1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® WINNER FROM GROVES

(Austin) ­ Groves resident Marlon Coleman did not have to match all the numbers in Friday's Mega Millions® drawing to win $1 million. His Quick Pick ticket from the B & B Mini Mart at 6850 25th Street in Groves matched all five numbers (14 ­ 33 ­ 34 ­ 54 ­ 56) but not the Mega Ball (37). Coleman selected the Megaplier® option and quadrupled his $250,000 prize to $1 million. "With tonight's Mega Millions jackpot estimated to be a whopping $244 million, it's good to know players can win significant prizes even if they don't match every number," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Our players can choose the Megaplier option for just $1 more per playboard, and sometimes it pays off in a big way." Coleman requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $244 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $101 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million.
