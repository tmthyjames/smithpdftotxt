RESIDENT OF TROUP WINS COOL MILLION PLAYING TEXAS LOTTERY® BLACK SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­ Jimmie L. McCoy of Troup took home $1 million, the top prize in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Texas Lottery® Black, a $10 game. "We released this game in January of this year, and it has been so successful that we've issued a second version of it," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "At this $10 price point and with more than $44 million in total prizes, Texas Lottery® Black has become an instant favorite among players. The game has six prizes of $1 million, and McCoy's was the fourth claimed. Two remain unclaimed." The Rite Track #8, located at 502 W. Duval Street in Troup, sold the ticket. As a result of selling this top-prize-winning ticket, the retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $244 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $101 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
