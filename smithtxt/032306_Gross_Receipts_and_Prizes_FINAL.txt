2005 CHARITABLE BINGO GROSS RECEIPTS TOP $633.6 MILLION, SIXTH LARGEST-EVER YEAR SINCE 1982
(AUSTIN) ­ Non-profit organizations across Texas that conduct charitable bingo games reaped significant gains during calendar year 2005, bringing in just over $633.6 million or 4.8 percent more in gross receipts than in 2004. "Calendar year 2005 was the sixth-highest year for gross receipts since we started keeping records in 1982, and $29.1 million above the 2004 figure of $604.5 million," said Billy Atkins, director of the charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The gross receipts are a clear indicator of bingo's popularity, and they also tell the story of why there was a notable rise in total prizes. Prizes in 2005 were $471,390,751, $26.8 million more than in 2004." Most of the 1,265 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes also sell pull-tabs.
