ARLINGTON LLC CLAIMS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ ICQY Consulting LLC, Dzung Q. Tran, member, of Arlington, claimed a $1 million second-tier Mega Millions® prize Friday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Dallas. The LLC's ticket matched all five numbers (3­5­10­26­27), but not the Mega Ball (27) drawn on Feb. 14. This qualified the winner for a second-tier prize worth $250,000, but since the Megaplier® feature was included as part of the purchase for $1 more, the prize was automatically increased to $1 million. The winning ticket was purchased at the Tiger Mart #33 located at 2215 N. Main St. in Cleburne. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $363 million. Wednesday's Powerball ® jackpot is an estimated $50 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
