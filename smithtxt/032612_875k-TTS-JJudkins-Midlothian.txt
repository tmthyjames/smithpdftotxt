MIDLOTHIAN MAN CLAIMS HIS $875,000 HALF OF MARCH 22 TEXAS TWO STEP® $1.75 MILLION JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ On Friday, James Judkins of Midlothian visited the Texas Lottery® claim center in Fort Worth to claim the first half of the $1.75 million jackpot ­ $875,000 ­ for the Texas Two Step® drawing held March 22. Judkins' ticket was one of two sold that matched all four numbers (8 ­ 13 ­ 23­ 32) and the Bonus Ball (28) picked in the drawing. "I was pretty nervous when I went back to the store to check my ticket," said Judkins. "This is so unreal, it's still hard to believe I really won." Judkins said he planned to use some of his winnings to pay off his parents' bills and mortgage, and will put the rest in the bank to "set for a while." First though, he said he and his brother are planning on a fishing trip to Florida. "I hope Mr. Judkins' luck on his fishing trip is just as good as it was with Texas Two Step," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "This was our largest Texas Two Step jackpot in almost two years and we're looking forward to meeting our other winner." Judkins purchased his winning ticket at the 7-Eleven #34143 located at 3429 N. Tarrant Parkway in Fort Worth. The retailer will receive a $5,000 bonus for selling one of the two winning tickets for the drawing. Texas Two Step drawings are held on Mondays and Thursdays at 10:12 p.m. CST. The game features overall odds of one in 32 and a $5 prize just for matching the Bonus Ball. Rolling jackpots start at $200,000 and are paid in one lump-sum payment.
