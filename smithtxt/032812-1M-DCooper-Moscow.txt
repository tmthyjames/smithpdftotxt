NEWLY REDESIGNED POWERBALL® GAME MINTS SECOND MILLIONAIRE IN TEXAS UNDER NEW RULES
(AUSTIN) ­ David R. Cooper of Moscow, Texas, became the second Texas Lottery® player to claim a second-tier prize in the newly redesigned Powerball® game. He selected his own numbers for the Feb. 29 drawing and matched all five numbers (1 ­ 4 ­ 11 ­ 23 ­ 26), but not the Powerball (14). Cooper claimed his $1 million prize at the Texas Lottery claim center in Houston. Launched in January of this year, the new Powerball features bigger starting jackpot prizes, better odds of winning and more chances to win $1 million. The next Powerball drawing will be held tonight, with an estimated jackpot of $50 million. Overall odds of winning any Powerball prize are one in 32. Cooper purchased his ticket at Big Ben's, 16281 Highway 59 North in Moscow. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $500 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
