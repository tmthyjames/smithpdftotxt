DECISION TO MEGAPLY® UPS $250,000 PRIZE TO GUARANTEED $1 MILLION
(Austin) ­ Large jackpots like last Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot, which was advertised at $312 million and eventually raised to $319 million based on sales, seem to get all the attention, but did you know you could win $1 million without matching all the numbers? That's what Eric Moreno of Baytown did not too long ago. Moreno matched the five numbers drawn (6 ­ 18 ­ 36 ­ 40 ­ 49), but not the Mega Ball (7), and qualified for the second-tier prize in the Mega Millions drawing held December 28, 2010. Because he selected the Megaplier® option, his prize increased from $250,000 to $1 million. "The Megaplier add-on feature was first offered in Texas when we joined the Mega Millions group in 2003," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Since that time, it has become a popular feature, helping us generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas." The winner, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his Quick Pick ticket from the Valero Corner Store #2584 located at 3324 NASA Parkway in Seabrook. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $153 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $9 million.
