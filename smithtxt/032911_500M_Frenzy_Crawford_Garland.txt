  FIRST PRIZE OF $1 MILLION IN $500 MILLION

FRENZY WON BY GARLAND RESIDENT
(Austin) ­ Margaret Crawford of Garland plunked down $20 at the First Minit Markit counter for a $500 Million Frenzy scratch-off ticket and won the first of the game's 40 prizes of $1 million. "We issued $500 Million Frenzy just at the beginning of this month, and it's already number one in scratch-off sales," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "This game offers 10 top prizes of $2.5 million, none of which have been claimed. After Ms. Crawford's claim, 39 additional prizes of $1 million remain unclaimed. With more than half a billion dollars in prizes, it's no surprise this ticket is a hit with our players." $500 Million Frenzy also has 296 third-tier prizes of $25,000 and 886 fourth-tier prizes of $10,000, a few of which have been claimed in each category. The store is located at 5150 Duck Creek Drive #107 in Garland. For selling this ticket, the store is eligible to receive a retailer bonus of $10,000. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $9 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $153 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
