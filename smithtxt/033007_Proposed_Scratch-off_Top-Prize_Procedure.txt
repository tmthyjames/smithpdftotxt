TEXAS LOTTERY COMMISSION IMPLEMENTS REVISED CLOSING PROCEDURES FOR SCRATCH-OFF GAMES
(AUSTIN) ­The Texas Lottery Commission has implemented revised procedures that would promptly initiate the game-closing process for scratch-off games after all the top prizes in the game have been claimed. In addition, the Commission proposed a related rule that tracks proposed legislation, which will be published in the Texas Register on April 6 to begin a 30-day public-comment period. "When all the top prizes in a game have been claimed, game closing procedures will be initiated," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "That's what these revised procedures do, and they mirror the intent of proposed legislation. The new language also shortens from 60 to 45 days the period after which the sale of tickets from such games is prohibited. During the 45 day time period, we will aggressively collect these games from our 16,000-plus retailer locations." The revised procedures include notification to retailers via an electronic message showing games in which all top prizes have been claimed and directing them to immediately cease sales of the identified games. The procedures also include notification on the Lottery's Web site to show that the game is closing. Beginning April 27, 2007, players may also request a print-out from retailers listing the number of top prizes unclaimed for scratch-off games identified by the Texas Lottery Commission as being of special interest to players.
