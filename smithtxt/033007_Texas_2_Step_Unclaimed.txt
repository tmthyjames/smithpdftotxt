TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO CLAIM THE TEXAS TWO STEP® TOP PRIZE FROM THE OCTOBER 2 DRAWING (AUSTIN) ­ An unclaimed Texas Two Step® ticket worth $1,075,000
will expire on March 31, 2007. "We encourage every player who participated in the October 2 drawing to double-check their tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "If getting to a claim center is a problem, the ticket can be mailed in as long as it is postmarked no later than Saturday." The winning numbers drawn were 6 - 20 - 28 - 31, and the bonus ball was 23. A ticket matching all four numbers and the bonus ball was sold at the Exxon Express Market, 505 N. Harvey Mitchell Parkway in Bryan. If no claimant comes forward, the prize money will be transferred to the Unclaimed Prize Fund. The first $10 million in unclaimed prizes each fiscal year is allocated to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) through the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. After that, unclaimed prize money goes to the General Revenue Fund. As of the end of February, the Unclaimed Prize Fund had received $31,087,886 for Fiscal Year 2007 which began on September 1, 2006. Tickets for online games such as Texas Two Step® are valid for 180 days after the drawing date.
