PICK 3TM GREEN BALLTM BONUS DRAWING RETURNS
APRIL 4-30 WITH CHANCES TO WIN BIGGER PRIZES

(Austin) ­ The Pick 3TM Green BallTM drawing is back. Starting Monday, April 4 through Saturday, April 30, for no extra cost, Pick 3 players will have the chance to win approximately 20 percent more each time the green ball is drawn. "Pick 3 has consistently been one of our most popular drawing games, and we believe this promotion will only increase the excitement around this game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. This Green Ball bonus-draw promotion will follow the same format as the previous promotion held in October 2010. Five white balls and one green ball will be placed in a drawing machine. One ball will be randomly selected after each Pick 3 day and night drawing. Every time a white ball is selected, it will be removed from the drawing machine. This increases the chances of the green ball being selected in the next drawing. When the green ball is drawn, the Pick 3 prizes will increase by approximately 20 percent, and all five white balls plus the green ball will be reloaded into the machine for the next drawing.
