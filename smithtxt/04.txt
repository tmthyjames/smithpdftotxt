Fort Worth Woman Claims Weekly Grand Prize
(Austin, December 14) - - Having a husband with a bah-humbug attitude about Christmas decorations made Mary Leta King a frosty $1 million. Knowing his dislike for putting up decorations, Mrs. King sent her husband, Paul, away from the house while she and her son, Jack, his wife, Mary Ann, and their daughter, Mandy, made the house festive with holiday lights and garlands of holly. Mr. King made himself useful by taking his wife's car and filling the tank at the nearby gas station, where he purchased two Weekly Grand tickets. "When he came home he told us, 'You all better be really nice to me now because I just won a million dollars,' and I thought to myself, 'This guy's pulling my leg,'" she said. "He always buys a lottery ticket of some kind when he puts gas in the car, and all I can say is he must have been feeling flush that day because he bought two tickets, spent four whole dollars." After Mandy looked at the ticket and pronounced it a winner, Mrs. King thought it was turning into a Christmas conspiracy. "So then my son looked at it and said it looked like it could be the real thing," she said. "I thought to myself 'They're all in cahoots.' So I let it go and got on with the business of decorating, but I made sure they put the ticket in a safe place." After mulling it over, Mrs. King decided it would be best if her husband called the Lottery, just in case the ticket turned out to be the winner it appeared to be. Mrs. King recently retired from her job with the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth, where she worked for more than 20 years. She said she was proud of her long tenure with the Diocese and left at a time when the schools were full and interest in religious participation was at a peak. The 80-year-old King recently underwent an ankle transplant, an experimental procedure that is performed in only four cities in the United States. "I had the operation in Dallas eight months ago," she said. "I'm taking seven different prescriptions right now, so winning this $1,040,000 will go a long way to help pay for the medicines that have gotten very expensive." In the meantime, Mr. King, a toolmaker who works 40 hours per week, will continue his Scrooge ways, play tennis a few times a week, and continue buying Lottery tickets every time he goes to the gas station. The Kings have been married 60 years. The retailer, Stop N Go #2238 at 6700 Crowley Road in Fort Worth, is eligible to receive a one-percent bonus of the top prize, which is $10,000. This is the 52nd Weekly Grand top prize to be awarded since the game debuted in 1995. -30.... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
