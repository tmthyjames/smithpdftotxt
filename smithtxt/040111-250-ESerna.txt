MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER FROM ALICE WINS $250,000 SECOND-TIER PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Evangelina Serna of Alice wins a $250,000 secondtier prize in the Mega Millions® game from the Texas Lottery®. Serna says she is "almost a regular player" who has played the Texas Lottery for nearly three years. She buys $5 in Quick Pick tickets for whichever game has the highest jackpot. "We are always glad to see a high jackpot in one of our games because we know larger jackpots tend to translate into increased sales and more revenue for the Foundation School Fund," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Still, we remind our players to enjoy the Games of Texas responsibly, and it appears Ms. Serna did just that." Adrian's Drive-In Grocery, 601 South Reynolds St. in Alice, sold Serna the ticket, which matched five numbers (22 ­ 24 ­ 31 ­ 52 ­ 54) but not the Mega Ball (4) for the Mega Millions drawing held Friday, March 25. Although she has no immediate plans for the money, Serna is enjoying the win just the same. "I feel great and numb," she explained before adding, "and of course happy!" Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $19 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $187 million, and the LottoTexas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
