TOMBALL RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION PRIZE AFTER PLAYING TEXAS LOTTERY® BLACK SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­A top prize of $1 million is what Travis Hoffman of Tomball found after buying and scratching a ticket in the Texas Lottery® $10 scratch-off game, Texas Lottery® Black. "This is the fifth of the game's six top prizes of $1 million claimed, which is a sensational track record for a game that just went on sale January 17 of this year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "One top prize remains unclaimed in this game that's had such remarkable sales that we issued a second version, Texas Lottery® Black Series II-Limited Edition, two weeks ago." Hoffman bought the ticket at Walter's Quik Stop, 15222 FM 2920, Suite A, in Tomball. His big win makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. The odds of winning any prize in Texas Lottery® Black are one in 3.32, including break-even prizes. The odds of winning the top prize are one in one million. Hoffman requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $19 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $187 million. There is more information about the Texas Lottery available on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
