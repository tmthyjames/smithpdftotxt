INSTINCT MAY BE THE KEY TO THE TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ Trusting his instincts paid off Thursday for Yukwan Savero of Dallas. For the last four years, he has been unsure about the best tactic for winning the Texas Two Step®. "Sometimes I used the Quick Pick, and sometimes I played my own numbers," admits Savero. His lucky numbers brought home the $900,000 jackpot, and those numbers were 1 ­ 13 ­ 28 ­ 33 with a Bonus Ball of 12. Although he has plans for the money, he's keeping them to himself for now. However he did share one of his plans ­ keep playing Texas Two Step. "Many of our players have become loyal to certain games over the years," responded Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "It is good to see that loyalty pay off not only for the players but also for Texas Education." Since 1997, well over $9 billion dollars has been transferred to the Foundation School Fund. For selling the winning ticket, the TETCO #625 at 9791 Forest Lane in Dallas is eligible to receive a $9,000 bonus. Thursday's estimated Texas Two Step jackpot is $225,000.
