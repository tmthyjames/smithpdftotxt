MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT GENERATES RECORD SALES FOR
TEXAS LOTTERY, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR TEXAS EDUCATION
(AUSTIN) ­ Last Friday's world-record Mega Millions® $640 million drawing may not have produced a Texas jackpot winner, but the record sales it generated did produce winners all across the state, including the most important winner of all--Texas education. "Here at the Texas Lottery, we like to say that when Texans play, Texas wins--that includes players, retailers and, most of all, Texas education," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "That saying has never been truer than with this record-shattering Mega Millions jackpot. Even without a jackpot-winning ticket, Friday's drawing resulted in millions of dollars in winnings for our players, huge commissions for our retailers and a very significant contribution to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in our state." A total of 1,385,498 winning Mega Millions tickets were sold in Texas for the drawing, including 14 second-tier winners of $250,000 each, and well over a million winners of lower-tier prizes from $2 to $10,000, for a total of nearly $10.6 million. Texas Lottery retailers earn a 5 percent commission on every ticket sold, which equates to more than $4.7 million for this roll cycle. There are nearly 17,000 retailers licensed to sell Texas Lottery tickets across the state. Approximately 39.8 percent of all Texas Mega Millions proceeds are transferred to the state's Foundation School Fund. That means around $37.5 million for Texas education as a result of sales for this roll cycle. Through Monday, five of the 14 players who matched all five numbers (2­4­23­38­46) but not the Mega Ball (23) drawn Friday night have already come forward to claim their $250,000 prizes:    Marvin Rodriguez of Dallas Juan E.
