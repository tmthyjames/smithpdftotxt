PRIZES OF $1 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION CLAIMED BY TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYERS FROM HOUSTON
(Austin) ­ Texas Lottery® players from Houston claimed prizes of $1 million and $1.2 million in the last few days. On Friday, Clifton Hubert claimed a second-tier Powerball® prize of $1 million. He chose to take advantage of the Power Play® add-on feature, and his decision raised his second-tier prize from $200,000 to a guaranteed $1 million. Hubert picked his own numbers and matched five of the numbers drawn (4 ­ 10 ­ 11 ­ 19 ­ 33), but not the Powerball (27), for the drawing held March 26. He purchased his ticket at the Sunrise Mini Mart, 1703 McCarty Drive in Houston. Today, the BGKM Trust, Gerald Daniel II, Trustee, claimed the $1.2 million Texas Two Step® jackpot prize from the drawing held December 13, 2010. The Quick Pick ticket matched all four numbers (8 ­ 13 ­ 23 ­ 30) plus the Bonus Ball (35). For selling the winning ticket, the Kroger #252 Fuel located at 11035 East Freeway in Houston is eligible for the maximum Texas Two Step retailer bonus of $10,000. These claimants requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $30 million. Wednesday's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $218 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $11 million.
