"SURPRISED" SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT WINS TRIP TO LAS VEGAS WITH THE PRICE IS RIGHT® SCRATCH-OFF

(Austin) ­ Alfonso N. Diaz of San Antonio won a trip to Las Vegas in a second-chance drawing for the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game The Price is Right®. "I got the letter in the mail," said Diaz. "I was surprised." Introduced February 14, The Price Is Right® game features more than $23 million in prizes. Two top prizes of $50,000 and four second-tier prizes of $5,000 currently remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.72, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can send in their non-winning tickets for a chance to go to Las Vegas for a special The Price is Right® stage show comprised exclusively of Texas Lottery trip winners. Prizewinners will be randomly selected to bid on an item in Contestants' Row. In addition, four randomly selected winners will spin the Big Money Wheel for a chance to qualify for prizes ranging from $1,000 to $1 million. Four drawings will be held to give away 24 four-day, three-night trips, including airfare, hotel accommodations and spending money. The first drawing occurred on March 22. The deadline to enter the next drawing is April 29. Players can complete their entries by filling out the back of each non-winning ticket, affixing a first-class stamp and mailing.
