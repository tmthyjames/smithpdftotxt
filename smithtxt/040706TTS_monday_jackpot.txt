MONDAY'S $1.8 MILLION ESTIMATED JACKPOT TIES TEXAS TWO STEP® RECORD
(AUSTIN) ­ The estimated jackpot for Monday's Texas Two Step® drawing will tie the Texas Lottery® game's record high of $1.8 million set on March 25, 2003. "With better odds of winning than some of our other on-line games, Texas Two Step has been an attractive addition to the Games of Texas for almost five years now," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And with Monday's record-tying jackpot up for grabs, there's never been a better time to give Texas Two Step a try!" Texas Two Step, which began in May 2001, features two drawing a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, at 10:12 p.m. Players choose four numbers from 1 to 35, and one bonus ball number from 1 to 35. Texas Two Step jackpots start at $200,000 and increase until at least one ticket matches all four numbers plus the bonus ball. There are seven different ways to win, and all prizes, including the jackpot prize, are paid in one lump sum. The overall odds of winning for Texas Two Step are 1 in 32. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million. "We'd certainly be excited to see someone claim this jackpot, but if no ticket matches all four numbers plus the bonus ball in Monday night's drawing, players will have another chance at a new Texas Two Step record jackpot on Thursday," said Sadberry.
