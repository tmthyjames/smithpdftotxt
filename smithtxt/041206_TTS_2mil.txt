PUT ON THOSE DANCING SHOES, THURSDAY'S ESTIMATED TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT A RECORD $2 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ Thursday's estimated $2 million jackpot for Texas Two Step® surpasses the Texas Lottery® game's previous record of $1.8 million set on March 25, 2003. "We've waited almost five years for this Texas Two Step record jackpot and if anyone matches all four numbers plus the bonus ball, they'll be dancing all the way to the bank," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And the $2 million jackpot is not all that's on the line because Texas Two Step offers seven different ways to win. In the last drawing, thousands of Texas Two Step players matched enough numbers to claim prizes ranging from $5 to more than $3,000!" Texas Two Step, which began in May 2001, features two drawings a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, at 10:12 p.m. Players choose four numbers from 1 to 35, and one bonus ball number from 1 to 35. Texas Two Step jackpots start at $200,000 and increase until at least one ticket matches all four numbers plus the bonus ball. All prizes, including the jackpot prize, are paid in one lump sum. The overall odds of winning for Texas Two Step are 1 in 32. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million. In addition to Thursday night's record estimated jackpot of $2 million, tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $27 million and Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $220 million.
