TWO SCRATCH-OFF TICKETS WORTH $1 MILLION EACH CLAIMED BY TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYERS IN SAN ANTONIO
(Austin) ­ Texas Lottery® players from San Antonio claimed $1 million with two different scratch-off tickets. Coincidentally, both prizes were the third prizes of $1 million awarded in each of the games. Elva Valdez purchased a $500 Million Frenzy ticket at the EZ Shop #3, 1130 New Laredo Highway in San Antonio. Mary Ramirez purchased a Texas Lottery® Black Series II ­ Limited Edition ticket at the Big Diamond #1038, 3890 FM 1604 E. North, also in San Antonio. Both stores are eligible for $10,000 retailer bonuses for selling the winning tickets. "It is certainly noteworthy that both of these winners came from San Antonio, and they won with two of our most popular games. In fact, the $500 Million Frenzy and the Texas Lottery® Black Series II ­ Limited Edition were two of the top three games for total sales last week," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. Three top prizes of $1 million remain unclaimed in Texas Lottery® Black Series II ­ Limited Edition. The $500 Million Frenzy has 37 second-tier prizes of $1 million and ten top-prizes of $2.5 million currently unclaimed. These claimants requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $56 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million.
