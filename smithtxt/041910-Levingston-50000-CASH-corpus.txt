CORPUS CHRISTI RESIDENT GETS PREPPED FOR RETIREMENT WITH TOP PRIZE IN $50,000 CASH
(Austin) ­ With retirement on the December 2010 horizon, Albert Levingston Jr. of Corpus Christi got a push toward his happy goal with a top prize of $50,000 in cash from a Texas Lottery® scratchoff also called $50,000 Cash. "I think we won some money," Levingston said to his wife while scratching the ticket at home. "I always split my winnings with her, but even so, all she could say was, `No way!' when I told her." Levingston returned to the store to use the check-a-ticket terminal to ensure that his eyes weren't playing tricks on him. "This money came just in time," he said. "I'm going to pay my bills and get ready for retirement. I've been playing the lottery for nearly 18 years, since it started, and I've learned that to win you just have to play." "We're pleased to say that Mr. Levingston has claimed the sixth of the seven top prizes offered in this game and thereby gotten closer to his much-anticipated retirement," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Long-time players, like Mr. Levingston, have helped the lottery accomplish its mission to deliver proceeds back to the state and to the Foundation School Fund to benefit public education in Texas." Levingston purchased the ticket at the Town Market #1, 514 Old Robstown Road in Corpus Christi. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $143 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $80 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $252 million.
