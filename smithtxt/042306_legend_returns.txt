A LEGEND RETURNS!
(AUSTIN) ­ Starting today, Texas Lottery® players will find the Lotto Texas® game they know and love has returned! It's "goodbye" to the bonus ball, and "hello" to picking a straight set of six numbers from a field of 54. "No more bonus ball," said Acting Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Along with the play style that's a favorite among our players, the odds of winning the jackpot are better, too." Players win the jackpot by matching all six numbers from a Lotto Texas drawing held every Wednesday and Saturday night. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 25.8 million. Other prizes for matching the numbers drawn include: · Matching 5 of 6 numbers ­ estimated $2,000 · Matching 4 of 6 numbers ­ estimated $50 · Matching 3 of 6 numbers ­ guaranteed $3 The overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 71. All prizes are based on a pari-mutuel prize payout, except the guaranteed $3 prize. "Returning to the old play style distinguishes our Lotto Texas game from our other jackpot-driven games," said Sadberry. "Since the Lotto Texas game started in 1992, there have been nearly 500 jackpot tickets sold across the state and nearly $4.9 billion paid out to our players."
