HALLETTSVILLE TRUST CLAIMS $2 MILLION POWERBALL® PRIZE THANKS TO POWER PLAY®
(AUSTIN) ­ The 111012 Lottery Trust, Bill B. Caraway, Trustee, of Hallettsville claimed a Powerball® prize worth $2 million. The trust held a Quick Pick ticket which matched all five numbers drawn (32 ­ 42 ­ 50 ­ 54 ­ 55) but not the Powerball (32) for the $168 million drawing held Nov. 10, 2012. Normally this would make the ticket worth $1 million, but because the Power Play® option was selected for just $1 more, the prize doubled to $2 million. This winning ticket was sold at the Moulton Grocery & Market located at 100 S. Lavaca in Moulton. The claimant requested minimal publicity. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $40 billion in prizes to lottery players.
