PLAYERS SAY BYE TO BONUS BALL, LIGHTNING ALMOST STRIKES TWICE FOR 2001 LOTTO TEXAS® WINNER

(AUSTIN) ­ Wednesday night's Lotto Texas® drawing marked the return of the old 6-of-54 game matrix and almost marked the return of Arlington's James D. Ater to the jackpot winners' circle. As a member of the Triple J NXS Trust, Ater claimed a share of a $36 million Lotto Texas jackpot back in 2002. In Wednesday's drawing, Ater's ticket matched five of six numbers, not quite good enough for another jackpot, but still worth $1,709. Lotto Texas, which began in 1992, features two drawings a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, at 10:12 p.m. From May 2003, until Wednesday's drawing, Lotto Texas players had to match all five numbers, plus the Bonus Ball (more)

to claim the jackpot. Players now choose six of 54 balls. The current overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are 1 in 25.8 million and overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 71. All prizes are based on a pari-mutuel prize payout, except the guaranteed $3 prize. The jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is an estimated $36 million. Ater, who claimed his second-tier prize at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Fort Worth, says he's not about to quit playing Lotto Texas now. "Let's see, last time I won, it was a 6-of-54 matrix and a $36 million jackpot," he said. "This Saturday, it's the same matrix and the same jackpot. I think I'll give it another shot!" "The return of a favorite game made Wednesday a big day for Lotto Texas players, especially Mr. Ater," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And with our largest Lotto Texas jackpot since February up for grabs on Saturday, one or more of our players, even Mr. Ater, could end up with an even bigger day, but we still want to remind everyone to play responsibly and remember ­ it only takes one ticket to win." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $30 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery Commission, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
