SAN ANTONIO TRUST CLAIMS TOP PRIZE IN TEXAS LOTTERY® $500,000 TOP PRIZE GAME
(AUSTIN) ­The JD Trust Fund, Joe S. Diaz, Trustee, of San Antonio on Friday claimed the top prize in $500,000 Top Prize, a scratch game from the Texas Lottery®. The game offers a prize of $50,000 per year for 10 years. Nick's Mini Mart, located 2819 South New Braunfels in San Antonio sold the ticket. "This ticket may be a record-setter for us, as no one has ever waited to claim a major prize until the day before the ticket expired, as this ticket would have last Saturday," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is game #805, which closed in the waning days of October 2008, and according to Texas Lottery regulations, any prizes won in an instant game must be redeemed within the deadline of 180 days after a game closes." The winner requested minimal publicity. Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $181 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million.
