EIGHTS FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN HOUSTON RESIDENT'S $10 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ Eight is Houston resident Oscar R. Martinez's favorite number. That's why he didn't stay home and rest after a long day on April 8. Instead, he stopped by the Timewise #4501, 1402 Eldridge Parkway in Houston, and purchased five dollars' worth of Lotto Texas® numbers. One of his Quick Picks (9 ­ 15 ­ 20 ­ 28 ­ 39 ­ 43) won him the $10 million jackpot, to be paid out in 25 installments of $400,000 each. Martinez even chose April 28 to claim his prize. "To be quite honest with you, I don't get to play as often as I'd like. I'm a paralegal, so I'm busy all the time," Martinez explained. "I'd just finished a bunch of errands and washed my car. I realized I forgot to buy my ticket, but I was really tired. I thought I'd just buy a ticket on Friday. Then I realized it was the eighth and in the eight o'clock hour." He says he chose the Quick Pick option this time due to fatigue, but sometimes plays his own numbers. "I usually play Lotto Texas or Mega Millions," said Martinez. "I've won $150 a few times. I usually get two or three numbers right." Despite his prior success, Martinez forgot to check his Lotto Texas ticket for a couple of days. "About 4:30 in the evening Friday, I checked my numbers and saw I'd won," he said.

Martinez called his mother and then told the rest of his immediate family. Perhaps it's not surprising that this loyal son has only one goal in mind for his winnings. He told lottery officials, "I want to take care of my family first." "Mr. Martinez is obviously a fortunate man," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "His winning ticket may be impressive, but his strong family ties are even more admirable." Convinced he has luck to spare, Martinez said, "I'll continue playing, still. It may seem crazy, but I feel lucky enough to win again." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $181 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million.
