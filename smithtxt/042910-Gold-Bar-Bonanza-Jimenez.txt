LATEST WIN KEEPS LUCKY STREAK GOING FOR AUSTIN WINNER OF $100,000 GOLD BAR BONANZA PRIZE
(Austin) ­ The only thing going through Gloria Jimenez's head as she was buying a Gold Bar Bonanza scratch-off game was that maybe she might win a little cash.

After all, she recently won a Hawaiian vacation in one raffle she entered, and continued her winning ways in another raffle by winning a week-long cruise to the Bahamas.

"I was outside the store when I scratched the ticket," she said. "I didn't think I was looking at it right, so I rubbed my eyes and rubbed the ticket, too. I was hoping to win a little money, but I sure wasn't expecting this."

She called her friend, Jorge, who came to her house to look at the ticket.

"I slept with the ticket that night and every night since," Jimenez said. "I plan to save and invest most of it, but I'll have some spending cash for the Bahamas cruise this summer and for the party I plan to have this weekend to celebrate winning this prize."

"Gold Bar Bonanza is a $10-ticket that we introduced just last January," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "All five top prizes of $100,000 have now been claimed, along with 26 second-tier prizes of $25,000 each, and more than one million lower-tier prizes ranging from $10 to $2,500. We extend our congratulations to Ms. Jimenez for claiming the last top prize in this game."
