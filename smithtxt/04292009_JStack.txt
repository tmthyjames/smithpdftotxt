NUMBER SYSTEM FINALLY PAYS OFF WITH $250,000 WIN FOR MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER FROM ORANGE
(AUSTIN) ­ Jacob Stack of Orange is a loyal Mega Millions® player with a trick for picking his numbers. His system finally paid off on Tuesday when his numbers (15 ­ 20 ­ 24 ­ 36 ­ 44) came up in the Mega Millions drawing. He only missed the Mega Ball (6). On Wednesday, he stopped at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Beaumont to receive his $250,000 second-tier prize. "I only play Mega Millions," said Stack. "I usually play when it gets to $30- or $40- million." Explaining his method, Stack said, "I picked the numbers by reviewing past numbers and selecting popular numbers. I have been playing the same numbers for approximately six months."

Although he's never won such a large prize before, he has had some luck in the past. "I've won $7 to $10 before, but nothing like this," he said. "We sometimes hear from players who enjoy trying to find patterns or other systems for choosing their numbers," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "There is no wrong way to enjoy Mega Millions, as long as you have fun and play responsibly." Stack plans to pay off some debts and help his family with his prize, but he also says he's not done winning just yet. "The Mega Millions is now up to $220 million. So, I'll probably buy a ticket this afternoon," he said. Stack purchased his winning ticket at OJ's Mobil Mart, 9508 Highway 12 in Orange. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $200,000. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
