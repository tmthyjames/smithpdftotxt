TWO WINNERS IN HOUSTON: ONE WINS $250,000, THE OTHER, $7.5 MILLION OVER TIME
(AUSTIN) ­Two claimants, one from Houston and the other visiting Houston, each collected a significant prize from the Texas Lottery® on Thursday. One prize worth $250,000 came from an online game and the $7.5 million top prize from a $20 scratch-off ticket. Florentina N. Castro of Henderson, Nevada, was visiting her son in Houston, and won $250,000 playing Mega Millions® on Tuesday. Castro told Lottery staff she was excited to come see her son in Texas. "What I can't believe is that I won this money," she added. "Texas is a lucky charm for me and for my son." Her ticket came from the Weslayan Phillips 66, 4910 Weslayan, in Houston. Don T Johnson of Houston claimed the top prize of $500,000 per year for 15 years after playing Super Set For Life. Johnson bought the ticket at the Almeda Shell and Church's, 13350 Almeda Road, in Houston. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. Johnson requested minimal publicity.

"More than a quarter of our 16,000-plus retailer base is located in the Houston area and the city itself is the largest metropolitan area in the state, so it isn't unusual to see winners from Houston frequently," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "But the fact is that we get winners from every nook and cranny of Texas, not just the major metropolitan areas. These two winners collecting their prizes on the same day was especially noteworthy." Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $225 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
