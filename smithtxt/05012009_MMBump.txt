MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT INCREASED TO ESTIMATED $225 MILLION FOR TONIGHT'S DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas Lottery® officials announced today that the Mega Millions® jackpot for tonight's drawing has been increased to an estimated $225 million based on higher-than-expected sales. That is a $5 million increase over the previous estimated jackpot of $220 million. "Although it is always exciting when Mega Millions reaches a high jackpot amount, an extra $5 million could increase interest in tonight's drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "As always, we wish our players luck and remind them to enjoy the game responsibly." The highest Mega Millions jackpot ever claimed in Texas totaled $128 million and went to the H & H Trust of Dallas. A record-breaking Mega Millions jackpot advertised at $370 million, but increased to $390 million based on sales, was split between two winning tickets in March of 2007. Tonight's drawing will occur at 10:12 p.m. and will be broadcast live on the official Texas Lottery Web site at http://www.txlottery.org and on television stations throughout the state. ... The Texas Lottery supports Texas education.
