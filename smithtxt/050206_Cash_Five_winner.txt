Mesquite Resident Takes A Moment To Win And Collect $29,741 Cash Five® Prize

Joyce Jackson of Mesquite collected more than $29,000 from the May 2nd Cash Five drawing.
(Austin, May 9) - Joyce Jackson leads an extremely busy life. The 60-year-old Mesquite resident attends Richland Community College, writes for the college paper, and has her own show on the college's Web-radio station, KDUX. It's no wonder she took a few days before visiting the Texas Lottery® Dallas Claim Center to collect her Cash Five® prize from the May 2 drawing, $29,741, before taxes.

"I figured a couple of days wouldn't hurt to wait to come in," said Jackson. "I've been so busy with school and I'm studying for my finals for the end of the semester. I love school and I've been a lifelong learner." Jackson and her husband didn't realize her ticket matched all five numbers from last Tuesday night's drawing. The two attended an awards ceremony in which Jackson received a drama award for a script she had written. (more)
