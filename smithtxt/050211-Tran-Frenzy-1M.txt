MAN FROM HALTOM CITY WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $500 MILLION FRENZY SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­ Money Tran of Haltom City won $1 million in $500 Million Frenzy, currently the topselling Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. "We released $500 Million Frenzy less than two months ago and it quickly became our most popular scratch-off game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The game offers 10 top prizes of $2.5 million, none of which have been claimed, and 40 prizes of $1 million. Mr. Tran's prize is the fourth of those claimed." Tran purchased the $20 game at the Kroger #542 located at 3300 Texas Sage Trail in Fort Worth. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this second-tier-prize-winning ticket. Tran requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow night's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. The Lotto Texas® jackpot for Wednesday is an estimated $7 million, and the Powerball jackpot is an estimated $36 million.
