WOODVILLE RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION PRIZE IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER GAME
(Austin) ­ Richard Weeks of Woodville claimed a $1 million prize in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster scratch-off game. Three top prizes of $2.5 million and 11 second-tier prizes of $1 million currently remain unclaimed. "We are nearing the two year anniversary of the launch of the $500,000,000 Blockbuster, yet it still remains one of the top-selling scratch-off games," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We also began the new $500,000,000 Frenzy in March, and it has already paid out four $1 million prizes since its introduction." Weeks purchased his winning ticket at the Dam B Jiffy Market located at 12234 Highway 190 East in Woodville. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. The $500,000,000 Blockbuster game features more than half-a-billion dollars in total prizes. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $36 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, visit www.txlottery.org. ###
