WOMAN FROM VAN ALSTYNE WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER GAME
(Austin) ­ Jeanna Gail H. Butler of Van Alstyne took home a prize of $1 million that she found in $500,000,000 Blockbuster, a $20 Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. "$500,000,000 Blockbuster continues to be a huge hit with our players, even two years after we released it," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's no wonder, since even at the second tier, there are such significant prizes available. Ms. Butler took home the 29th of the game's 40 prizes of $1 million, and there are still three prizes of $2.5 million that remain unclaimed." The retailer, Kwik-Chek #32, 1001 Van Alstyne Parkway, in Van Alstyne, is now eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket worth $1 million. Butler requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $36 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
