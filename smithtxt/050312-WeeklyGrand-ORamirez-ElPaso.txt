WEEKLY GRAND PRIZE WORTH MORE THAN $1 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ El Paso resident, Oscar Ramirez, traveled to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim a Weekly Grand top prize worth $1,000 per week for 20 years, not to exceed $1.04 million. The Kent Kwik #307 located at 4101 E. Highway 158 in Midland sold the winning ticket, making the store eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Ramirez, who requested minimal publicity, claimed the third of four top prizes available in the game. Overall odds of winning any Weekly Grand prize are one in 3.91, including break-even prizes. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $118 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $60 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $26 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $38 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed more than $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
