STINNETT PARTNERSHIP CLAIMS TOP PRIZE FOR TEXAS LOTTERY® SET FOR LIFE SCRATCH GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Today the Texas Panhandle has another multi-million dollar claim to fame. JPS Family Limited Partnership claimed one of the top-cash prizes for the Texas Lottery® SET FOR LIFE (# 603) Scratch Off game, which pays $5,000 per week, not to exceed $5 million. "Lately, luck seems to be following a westerly direction up into the Texas Panhandle," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "We've had an Odessa Monthly Bonus winner, a Lotto Texas jackpot ticket sold in Lubbock, and now luck has stopped over in the Panhandle town of Stinnett." JPS Family Limited Partnership, JPS Family Management, LLC, General Partner is managed by Paula G. Sotelo. Sotelo purchased the ticket at Leon Springs Country Store #6101, located at 25200 I10W #1 in Fair Oaks Ranch. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. The SET FOR LIFE scratch game offers players the chance to win $5,000 a week. As of today, there is one top prize left unclaimed. Other cash prizes range from $10 to $2,500. The cost to play is $10 and the overall odds of winning a prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 3.47. Representatives of JPS Family Limited Partnership have requested minimum publicity.
