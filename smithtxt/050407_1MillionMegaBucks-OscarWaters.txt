SECOND TICKET PAYS OFF FOR $1,000,000 MEGA BUCKS TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF WINNER
(AUSTIN) ­ They say it takes two, and this time it certainly did. Oscar Waters of Amarillo says he's not sure why he decided to buy that first scratchoff ticket last Saturday. Yet, when his first Texas Lottery® ticket won $20, he didn't waste any time getting a second one. This time he chose $1,000,000 Mega Bucks (Game #742), and the ticket was a big winner. Although he has played scratch-offs since the Texas Lottery started selling tickets almost 15 years ago, he wasn't quite prepared for this. "I was in shock," said Waters, "but I didn't scream or jump." Instead, this cool customer folded his paper under his arm and headed out the door clutching a winning ticket worth $1 million, the third and final top prize for that game. His first order of business was to quit his job as a successful vacuum cleaner salesman. Now Waters is ready to enjoy his retirement complete with a new car and a new home. His plans include traveling, spending time with his family and volunteering in his community. "For some of our players, winning provides an opportunity to help others and reconnect with family," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "It is an admirable way to use the prize money." (more)
