Lottery. "His experience is proof that you can win big in Mega Millions even if you don't win the jackpot, and if you Megaply, you can multiply your nonjackpot winnings even more." Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 56, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 46. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times. Hernandez purchased his ticket at the Ocean Minimart IV located at 5101 E. Lancaster Ave. in Fort Worth. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot will be worth an estimated $66 million.
