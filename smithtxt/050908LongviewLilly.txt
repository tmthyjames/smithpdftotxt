LONGVIEW CASH FIVE® PLAYER KNOWS THE SECRET OF WINNING
(AUSTIN) ­ Markeyta Lilly of Longview possesses the secret of winning at the Lottery. At least, she says she does. "Many people might think they will never win," she said. "It won't hurt to try, though." By that, Lilly means buying a Texas Lottery® ticket to take a chance on winning a prize. In her case, it was a Cash Five® ticket. "I've been playing only a little while," she said. "I was lucky to just come up on a set of numbers from out of nowhere and won." Her prize was $13,786, before taxes. Lilly purchased her ticket at the DC Shamrock, 3607 S. Eastman Road in Longview. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $137.86, onepercent of the prize Lilly won. This prize was one of two for the May 1 Cash Five drawing. The other ticket that matched the numbers drawn was sold in Port Aransas. Lilly redeemed her prize at the Texas Lottery Tyler claim center. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $145 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $11 million.
