PORT NECHES RESIDENT WINS $13,786 PLAYING CASH FIVE® FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Linda Taylor of Port Neches carried a Texas Lottery
® ®

ticket that matched the five numbers drawn in the May 1 Cash Five drawing for several days before she learned the ticket was worth $13,786. "I never look at the news to find out about the lottery drawings," Taylor said. "Since I buy a Cash Five ticket every day, I usually check my tickets when I go to the 7-Eleven and that's how I find out if I won anything." True to her routine, Taylor went into her favorite convenience store and asked the clerk to run her tickets. "I was so shocked when the clerk told me what I'd won that I made her run the ticket through the terminal again," Taylor said. Taylor bought her ticket at the Super Stop #11, 1125 Jefferson Drive in Port Arthur. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $137.86, onepercent of the prize Taylor won. This prize was one of two for the May 1 Cash Five drawing. The other ticket that matched the numbers drawn was sold in Longview. Taylor redeemed her prize at the Texas Lottery Beaumont claim center. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $145 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $11 million.
