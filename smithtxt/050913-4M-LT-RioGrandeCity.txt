TRUST FROM RIO GRANDE CITY CLAIMS $4 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS®JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ The DEME Revocable Trust, Daniel Enrique Escamilla, Trustee, of Rio Grande City claimed the $4 million advertised jackpot from the March 20 Lotto Texas® drawing at Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin. The trust's ticket was the only ticket sold to match all six numbers drawn, 4 ­ 10 ­ 35 ­ 38 ­ 41 ­ 49. Since the claimant chose the annual payment option, the prize will be paid in 25 annual installments. "When they told me someone won the lotto with their own numbers at the store where I buy my tickets, I started to think maybe it was me," said Escamilla. "We are very thankful for our good fortune." The trust's ticket was purchased at the Stripes #2206 located at 2798 West Highway 83 in Rio Grande City. The store is eligible for a $40,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. The claimant requested minimal publicity.
