WACO WINNER WASTES NO TIME CLAIMING $30,000 BREAK THE BANK TOP PRIZE

(AUSTIN) ­ Yesterday morning, Ellis R. Cunningham of Waco purchased a Texas Lottery Break the Bank (game #605) scratch-off ticket in Bellmead and by noon, he had already arrived at Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin to claim one of the game's 24 top prizes ­ $30,000! "I didn't believe it at first, so I had to get my wife to take a look at the ticket just to make sure," said Cunningham. "I've got the check now and I still can't believe it!" Cunningham said the $2 Break the Bank game is about the only one he plays, though the most he'd ever won before was $200. He plans to donate some of his winnings to his church, but he hasn't decided what to do with the rest yet. "I'm sure my wife will have plenty of say in that," laughed Cunningham.
