SLEEPY BERTRAM SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER CLAIMS $75,000 RAISE THE STAKES TOP PRIZE

(AUSTIN) ­ Iris Gilmore of Bertram didn't sleep too well Wednesday night, but she was feeling a lot better yesterday after claiming a $75,000 top prize ® in the Texas Lottery Raise the Stakes scratch-off game. "I bought the ticket pretty late Wednesday night and I was sitting out on the back porch when I scratched it," said Gilmore. "I couldn't believe my eyes, so I hollered at my husband to come verify it!" After a restless night, Gilmore and her husband drove about an hour southeast to get the official verification of her ticket at the Texas Lottery Claim Center in Austin. Gilmore is a regular scratch-off and Cash Five® player, but she said the most she'd ever won before was $500 several years ago. This time, she knows exactly what she'll do with her winnings.

"I'm going to pay off all our bills and be debt free," said Gilmore. "I'm sure Mrs. Gilmore will sleep a lot better after collecting her $75,000 Raise the Stakes prize," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery. "This was the fourth of ten Raise the Stakes top prizes to be claimed, and there are thousands of lower-tier prizes remaining, so there are still plenty of opportunities to win." In addition to the $75,000 top prize for the $7 Raise the Stakes scratch-off game, other cash prizes include: $2,000, $500, $100, $50, $20, $15, $10 and $7. Gilmore purchased her ticket at the HEB #433 located at 105 South Boundary in Burnet. ® Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $80 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot will be worth an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery Commission, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
