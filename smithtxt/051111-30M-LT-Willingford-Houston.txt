HOUSTON RESIDENT CLAIMS LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT ADVERTISED AT $30 MILLION FOR MARCH 9 DRAWING
(Austin) ­ E J Williford of Houston today collected a Lotto Texas® cash-value-option jackpot worth $19.3 million advertised at $30 million for the drawing on March 9.

The Houston store where the winner bought the Quick Pick ticket, Amber Food Mart, 802 Highway 6 South, has already received its retailer bonus equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, $300,000. The numbers selected in the March 9 drawing were 53-29-46-28-2-6.

"You can't win it if you don't play," Williford said. "This is the 530th Lotto Texas jackpot awarded since sales of the game began in November of 1992," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Lotto Texas was our first jackpot-driven game, and it continues to generate revenue to support the Foundation School Fund and public education in Texas."

The new winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $9 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $65 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $27 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
