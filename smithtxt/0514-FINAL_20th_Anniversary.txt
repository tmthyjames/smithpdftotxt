The Texas Lottery was launched on May 29, 1992, when the first ticket was purchased by Gov. Ann Richards at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill. Richards had previously signed House Bill 54 on Aug. 26, 1991, creating the Texas Lottery. On Nov. 5 of the same year, Texas voters approved the Lottery by a two-to-one margin. In its first 24 hours, the Lottery set a world record for first day sales when Texans purchase 23.2 million tickets. The Lottery's start-up costs, with interest, were earned back during the first three hours of ticket sales. "Over the past 20 years, the Texas Lottery has generated $20 billion in revenue for the state and we are particularly proud of the $14 billion our retailers and players have helped us to contribute to public education since 1997. Those numbers are certainly something to commemorate and we look forward to another 20 years," said Grief.
