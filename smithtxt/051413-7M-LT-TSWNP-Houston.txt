The trust chose the Cash Value Option, making the ticket worth $7,495,292, before taxes. "I am personally excited to be here today representing the TSWNP Revocable Trust," said Sternberg. "I know that all of the members of the trust are grateful for this opportunity and recognize the responsibility that comes with it." The H-E-B Food Store #578, 4303 Kingwood Drive in Houston, received a $100,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission presented a ceremonial check to the retailer on May 3. "We are always excited to meet jackpot winners like the members of the TSWNP Revocable Trust and to congratulate them on their good fortune.
