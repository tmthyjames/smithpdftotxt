IT'S NO JOKE THIS TIME ­ JUSTIN RESIDENT CLAIMS $250,000 MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Stephen Hale of Justin, Texas, plays Mega Millions® several times a month and often teases his wife that he's won a big prize. They're both laughing all the way to the bank now after Stephen claimed a $250,000 second-tier Mega Millions prize Monday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Fort Worth. Mr. Hale's ticket matched all five numbers (3­15­29­35­54), but not the Mega Ball (8) in the drawing held May 11. Mr. Hale said he plans to use some of his winnings to pay off some bills, take a family vacation and maybe even take up a hobby. Mr. Hale purchased his winning ticket at Allsup's #2388 located at 952 S. FM 156 in Justin. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $90 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $38 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
