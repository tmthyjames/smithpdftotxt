More than half a billion dollars up for grabs this week with Powerball ® and Mega Millions ® games (AUSTIN) ­ With tonight's estimated $360 million Powerball ® jackpot, and no jackpot winners for last night's Mega Millions® drawing, lottery players across the country are playing for $550 million this week.

Friday's estimated $190 million Mega Millions jackpot has a cash value of $140.9 million. If there are no winners for tonight's Powerball drawing, the jackpot for Saturday's drawing will be an estimated $475 million. "Since joining the game in 2010, Texas has not had a Powerball jackpot winner and we would be thrilled to have a Texan claim this huge prize," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. In the past year, Powerball has created many millionaires in Texas with 30 lottery players winning second-tier prizes of $1 million and $2 million. Texas has had eight Mega Millions jackpot prize winners, the largest winner, William R. Kiefer of Katy, won $144 million in January 2010. The current Powerball jackpot started as a $40 million prize on Apr. 3, and is the result of 12 draws without a jackpot winner. The largest Powerball jackpot was an advertised $550 million for the drawing held on Nov. 28, 2012. Powerball is a multistate game sold in 45 jurisdictions. Powerball players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 59, plus the Powerball number from a field of 35.
