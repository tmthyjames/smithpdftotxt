HOUSTON TEXANS SECOND-CHANCE WINNER WILL TAKE FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOR SUITE WEEKEND
(Austin) ­ Mark Freeman of Rosenberg did not know what he had won when he first received notification his name was drawn in the final Houston Texans second-chance drawing from the Texas Lottery®. Now, he is "very excited" as he prepares for a Texans "VIP Suite Weekend" for 14 people. "I've been a Texans fan since day one, but winning suite tickets is awesome!" The second-chance prize includes travel and hotel accommodations for 14, dinner before the game, pre-game sideline passes, a private suite during the game and a team merchandise gift bag. Plus, a Texans Ambassador (retired NFL legend) will join the group during the game, and Freeman will have the chance to be in the Texans Tunnel during the presentation of the Texans starting line-ups. "I plan to get friends and family together for an awesome weekend," said Freeman. "For the past two years, the Texas Lottery has had the distinct pleasure of working with the Houston Texans to provide a scratch-off game with fantastic second-chance prizes," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Texans are a first rate organization, and it's no wonder our players, like Mr. Freeman, enjoy this game." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $97 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $11 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, visit www.txlottery.org. ###
