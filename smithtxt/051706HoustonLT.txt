HOUSTON TRUST CLAIMS LAST LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT UNDER OLD PLAYSTYLE
(AUSTIN) ­ The AB Revocable Living Trust today claimed the $64 million Lotto Texas® jackpot from the drawing held on February 8, 2006. The Quick Pick ticket was the last ticket to match all numbers from the previous Lotto Texas play style in which players chose five numbers and a Bonus Ball. The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, which paid more than $39 million, before taxes. "I offer my congratulations to our latest Lotto Texas jackpot winner," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We still have one Lotto Texas jackpot ticket unclaimed as of today. The ticket sold in Lubbock, the first one to match all numbers for the current play style, has yet to be turned over to us for validation." The ticket purchased for the February jackpot was bought at the Shop & Save, located at 2626 Yale Street in Houston. The retail owner has received a bonus of $500,000 for selling the jackpot-winning ticket. A representative of AB Revocable Living Trust has requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $8 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
