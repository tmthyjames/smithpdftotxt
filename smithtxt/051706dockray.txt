ALL IN A DAY'S WORK FOR BELTON TEXAS LOTTERY® WINNER; CLAIMS $250,000 CASH PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Deatri (Deedee) Dockray of Belton ended her shift at Smith Brother's Drive In on Saturday evening much the same as she normally does. Before leaving, she purchased one Texas Lottery® Wild Winnings scratch game. While scratching, Dockray chatted with the night clerk and while in the midst of the conversation, her normal night turned around. "I got to the end of the ticket and thought I hadn't won anything," said Dockray. "When I saw that last symbol match the one I needed to match and saw the amount, I just started running circles in the store." Dockray's Wild Winning ticket matched the correct symbols for the top cash prize of $250,000. The $10 ticket has other cash prizes ranging from $10 to $25,000. The odds of winning a prize, including break-even prizes are 1 in 3.29. "For four years I've watched other people win and was so happy for them," Dockray said. "My one wish was to win a $500 prize just so I could experience what it felt like. Now I know. I'm still in disbelief." "It's such a pleasure to hear how excited our players get when they have the opportunity to undergo an experience like that of Mrs. Dockray," said Acting Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "She told us that she wants to do some renovations at her home and pay some bills. I think she'll remember this entire event for a long time."
