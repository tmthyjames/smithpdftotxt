EL PASO RETAILER SELLS TEXAS' THIRD MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT TICKET; STATE STANDS TO WIN AS WELL
(AUSTIN) ­ Tuesday night's Mega Millions® drawing, worth an advertised $94 million, drew more than $11.2 million* in sales within the Lone Star State. Of that total, approximately $4.25 million will be earmarked for transfer to the state's Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in Texas. The other bonus for the state ­ the jackpot ticket that matched all five numbers and the gold Mega Ball was sold in El Paso. "We were very happy to hear of the ticket being sold, as it has been more than a year since the last Mega Millions jackpot ticket was bought in Texas," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "We have had some initial contact with a potential claimant; however, no one has come forward yet with the winning ticket." The ticket was purchased at the Good Times Store #12, located at 6390 Alameda Avenue. The retail owner will be eligible to receive a bonus equal to one-percent of the jackpot amount, $950,000. Retailer bonuses for selling a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket are capped at $1 million. "The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, and is worth more than $53 million, before taxes," Sadberry said. "We look forward to meeting with the ticket holder soon, but encourage claimants to speak to a trusted financial or legal advisor before claiming a prize of this magnitude."
*Sales total for roll cycle beginning April 21 through May 16
