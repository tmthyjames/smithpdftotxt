2006 1ST QUARTER CHARITABLE BINGO GROSS RECEIPTS TOP $174 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ Non-profit organizations across Texas that conduct charitable bingo games brought in $174.6 million in gross receipts during the first quarter of 2006, more than $10 million above the same period in 2005. Players also garnered prizes in excess of $127 million during the first three months of 2006, also an increase of $10 million more than in the first quarter of 2005." "Texas non-profits and charities hit the ground running in 2006, beginning the year with significant net receipts of $47.6 million, $2.2 million over what they were for the same time period in 2005," said Billy Atkins, director of the charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Net receipts are total gross receipts minus total prizes awarded and represent what the non-profits have available to pay their bingo expenses and to make their charitable distributions. It's clear that the non-profit organizations through their charitable bingo activities are doing well, as the numbers show. Most of the 1,292 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes also sell pull-tabs.
