TEXAS POWERBALL® TICKET SOLD IN BOERNE MATCHES FIVE NUMBERS TO WIN $1 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ While one jackpot winning ticket for last night's record Powerball® drawing was sold in Florida, one lucky Texan matched five numbers (10-13-14-22-52), but not the Powerball (11) to win $1 million. Additionally, 19 Texas tickets matched four numbers plus the Powerball to win $10,000. Since five of those players also purchased the Power Play® option, their prizes are increased to $40,000. Overall, there were 471,863 winning Powerball tickets sold in Texas for last night's drawing and 7,598,547 sold nationwide. "We're excited about the new Texas millionaire created as a result of last night's record-setting Powerball drawing," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. "But we're even more excited about how our incredible sales helped generate more revenue for public education." During yesterday's peak selling period between 7:00 p.m. and 7:59 p.m., the Texas Lottery had $2,202,278 in sales. For that same hour, sales per minute were $36,705. The Texas $1 million winning ticket was sold at the J.W. Hope #2 (Quick Pantry) located at 942 N. Main St. in Boerne. The final amount of the advertised $600 million jackpot was $590.5. This was the largest Powerball jackpot ever and the second-largest jackpot in history for any lottery game.
