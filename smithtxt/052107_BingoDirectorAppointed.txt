NEW DIRECTOR APPOINTED TO LEAD CHARITABLE BINGO OPERATIONS DIVISION
(AUSTIN) ­ On Wednesday, May 16, the Texas Lottery Commission appointed Mr. Philip D. Sanderson as the director of the Charitable Bingo Operations Division. A bingo staff member since 1994, Sanderson had served as the division's assistant director since 1998. In addition, he currently serves as co-chair of the Charitable Gaming Committee of the North American Gaming Regulators Association (NAGRA), a non-profit association of gaming regulators. "Last year, non-profit organizations conducting bingo in Texas posted more than $31 million in charitable distributions," said Sanderson. "I look forward to leading this division in regulating the most charitable game in Texas." Well over 1,200 non-profit and charitable organizations conduct bingo in Texas. Each organization is required to distribute a minimum of 35 percent of their adjusted gross receipts to charitable activities. These distributions benefit a wide array of worthwhile causes including veteran's organizations, homeless shelters, volunteer fire departments and services for needy children.
