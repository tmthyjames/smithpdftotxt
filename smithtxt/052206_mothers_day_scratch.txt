Mother's Day Scratch Ticket Present Brings Presidio Mom $50,000 Per Year For 10 Years
(Austin, May 22) - Delma P. Leyva of Presidio was sitting in the family truck with her husband and daughter when he told her to pick one of the two Texas Lottery® Top Prize $500,000 scratch tickets he held in his hand. When she did, she wound up with a Mother's Day present she won't ever forget: a $50,000 annuity prize for the next 10 years. "One $50,000 after another continued to show up as I scratched the ticket, and I thought that I couldn't possibly be playing the game correctly," Leyva said. "I handed the ticket to my daughter, who read the ticket and said I was playing the game the way I should." It wasn't until Leyva got home and her son saw the ticket that she finally found out what the real deal was. "My son said the prize was that I was going to get $50,000 per year for the next 10 years," she said. "Then I really got nervous, and I've hardly eaten or slept since Mother's Day. Maybe tonight I can finally get some sleep." "The concept for the Top Prize $500,000 ticket is really noteworthy for players," said Texas Lottery Commission Acting Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "It's a $1-ticket that offers a significant annuity for 10 years, and creates a lot of excitement for winners and players alike." Mrs. Leyva's husband, Dulces, also won a prize with his $500,000 Top Prize, although not nearly as exciting as his wife's ticket produced. "My husband won $4," she said. "He told me that he's through buying tickets for other people. A few weeks ago, he bought a ticket for a co-worker and the man won $200. The ticket he bought for himself didn't win him a prize." She and her husband will use the prize money to build rental properties. Leyva purchased the ticket at the Presidio 66/Silver Streak Store, 104 O'Reilly, in Presidio.

"All this time I've been happy, nervous and scared," Leyva said. "In fact, I'd even say I felt a little crazy for the last week. But, it's a good way to feel crazy."
