TWO CORPUS CHRISTI RESIDENTS EACH WIN LAS VEGAS TRIP IN SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Rose Flores and Roman Mendez of Corpus Christi each won a trip to Las Vegas to attend a special taping of The Price is Right® Live! stage show because their names were selected in a Texas Lottery® The Price Is Right® scratch-off game second-chance drawing. Flores told lottery officials she was so happy that she "jumped up and down." Mendez said he felt "blessed" to win this prize. "Getting to attend a special taping of the venerable game show is only one part of the prize package," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It also includes round-trip airfare for two, $1,000 spending cash in Las Vegas, hotel accommodations for two and all ground transports to and from the airport, hotel and studio." The Price Is Right® offers more than $23.2 million in prizes and one in 3.72 odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes. Flores has one piece of advice for lottery players: "Don't give up and send in those tickets." Mendez requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $26 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $144 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is available on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
