CHARITABLE BINGO CELEBRATES 30th ANNIVERSARY WITH FIRST QUARTER INCREASE IN ALLOCATIONS

(AUSTIN) ­ Celebrating 30 years since the first licenses for Charitable Bingo were issued, the state's Charitable Bingo Operations Division today announced that first quarter total allocations of $6.69 million were up 3.1 percent from the previous quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2011, total allocations were $6.49 million. "What better way to celebrate our 30th anniversary than to report increases in allocations to local jurisdictions and the state of Texas," said Charitable Bingo Director Phil Sanderson. "Since 1982 local charities have received more than $1 billion, players have won $12 billion in prizes and gross receipts have surpassed the $16 billion mark." In the first quarter of 2012, allocations released to128 jurisdictions across the state resulted in nearly $3.2 million to cities and counties. Charitable Bingo also sent more than $3.5 million to the state's General Revenue Fund. Allocations are the result of prize fees collected from players that won bingo prizes in January, February and March in games conducted by nonprofit organizations. As required by law, 5 percent of a prize awarded is withheld from the winner and deposited in a non-dedicated account in the General Revenue Fund. Cities and counties that imposed the gross receipt tax on a local-option basis on or before Jan. 1, 1993, receive quarterly payments of up to 2.5 percent of the prizes won by bingo players in their jurisdictions.
