Bingo Pull-Tabs Post Largest-Ever SingleQuarter Sales Numbers
(AUSTIN, May 26) - Pull-tabs posted the highest sales ever for a single quarter during the period from January through the end of March this year. Sales of pull tabs were $68.9 million, with instant prizes totaling more than $50.3 million. "Pull-tab sales continue to be red-hot at charitable bingo halls across the state, and accounted for 39 percent of total bingo receipts for the first quarter of 2006," said Billy Atkins, director of the charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Pulltabs let players know immediately if they've won a prize, and that's part of their great popularity." Gross receipts for the first quarter of the year were $174.6 million. In 2002 a new style of pull-tab game was approved for sale in Texas and those games have resulted in a dramatic increase in sales. From 2002 to 2003 sales of pull-tab tickets increased 45 percent and sales have continued to increase every year since. Most of the 1,262 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes sell pull-tabs.
