MYSTERY SOLVED: BRIDGE CITY RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ After a full week of speculation and excitement, the owner of the $1 million Mega Millions® ticket purchased in Bridge City has come forward. Bridge City resident Dennis Moore Jr. claimed his prize at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Beaumont. Moore said, "My first thought was, `This cannot be possible.' I called my mom first. Then my wife and sister-in-law called the rest of the family." His Quick Pick ticket was the only second-tier winner in Texas for the drawing on May 19. It matched all five of the numbers drawn (2 ­ 4 ­ 9 ­ 15 ­ 42), but not the Mega Ball (13). "Mr. Moore's decision to Megaply this ticket really paid off," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Because the Megaplier `four' was selected before the drawing, his $250,000 secondtier prize became $1million."

Moore says the prize money will be put toward a piece of property he recently purchased. "I'd already made up my mind that I would have to go back to work to pay it off," said Moore. "It couldn't have happened at a better time. This was perfect." According to Moore, he hasn't given up on winning the jackpot. "I just hate that I didn't get the Mega Ball. Definitely, we'll keep playing." The winning Mega Millions ticket came from the Exxpress Mart #1, 1745 Texas Ave. in Bridge City. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
