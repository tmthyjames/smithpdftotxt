SECOND $1 MILLION PRIZE CLAIMED IN NEWLY INTRODUCED $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Introduced May 18, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster scratch-off game has already awarded a second prize of $1 million. Jeffrey A. Fugitt of Cedar Park claimed his prize Tuesday at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Austin. "The $500,000,000 Blockbuster is causing quite a bit of excitement," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "With 40 prizes of $1 million and ten prizes of $2.5 million, it stands to reason that we will continue to see players claiming large prizes in the coming weeks." The claimant requested minimal publicity. The winning ticket was sold by the 7-Eleven Conv Store #26353 located at 601 W. Ben White Blvd. in Austin. For selling the winning ticket, the retailer is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
