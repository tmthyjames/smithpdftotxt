DALLAS RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION-PLUS PRIZE IN JANUARY MEGA MILLIONS® DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Justin Emerson doesn't play any online game until the jackpot catches his attention, like the Mega Millions® drawing on January 4 did when the jackpot was advertised at $355 million.

"I figure the odds are the same as they are at the lower level jackpot, but the pay-off is better, so I might as well take a shot," Emerson said. "Winning this prize has really been surreal. I already know what I'm going to do with my winnings. After I buy a new car, I plan to go to law school next year."

"Mr. Emerson paid an additional dollar to Megaply his tickets and won a total of $1,000,008," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Because he selected the

Megaplier option, his $250,000 prize became $1 million, and his $2 prize was raised to $8. It's fitting that Mr. Emerson will use his prize to return to school. The Texas Lottery's mission is to generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund to support public education in Texas." Emerson purchased his Quick Pick ticket with the Megaplier® feature at the Hampton Texaco, 5909 S. Hampton, in Dallas. The numbers selected for that drawing were 4-8-15-25-47, and the Mega Ball was 42. Two out-of-state winning tickets divided the advertised jackpot.

Emerson did not have a publicity photo taken by lottery staff.
