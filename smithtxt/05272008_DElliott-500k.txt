ODESSA SCRATCH-OFF WINNER ALL SMILES
(AUSTIN) ­ Don L. Elliott of Odessa has no need to say "cheese," because he now has 500,000 reasons to smile. After claiming the third of five top prizes in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game Top Prize $500,000, he'll receive $50,000 per year for 10 years, but he almost missed out on the winning ticket. Elliott originally asked for his favorite $1 game, Find the 9's, but the Kent Kwik #203 located at 4203 N. Grandview Ave. in Odessa, had already sold out.

He enjoys playing scratch-offs, and even plays Mega Millions® when the jackpots get high enough. "Although many of our players develop a certain loyalty to one or two games, it appears that a change of pace paid off for Mr. Elliott," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Since this prize pays out over time, he'll enjoy the fun of winning for years to come." Both tonight's Lotto Texas® and Friday's Mega Millions jackpots are estimated to be worth $16 million. Tomorrow's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $350,000.
