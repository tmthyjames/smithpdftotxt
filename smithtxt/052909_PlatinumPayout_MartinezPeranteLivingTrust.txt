THE MARTINEZ PERANTE LIVING TRUST OF MESQUITE WINS $5 MILLION TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ The Mesquite-based Martinez Perante Living Trust, Benito G. Lozano, trustee, has claimed the top prize of $5 million in $130,000,000 Platinum Payout, a scratch game from the Texas Lottery®. The Family Stop Food Store, 1701 Bruton Road, in Mesquite sold the $50-ticket. Selling this top-prize-winning ticket makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000. "This has been a week of big wins for players who enjoy our instant games," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This winner took home a whopping $5 million prize, the second of this game's three top prizes to be claimed. Earlier this week, we had a topprize winner in Monthly Bonus and second-tier winners in Mega Millions and $500,000,000 Blockbuster. We also had a winner in Amarillo who collected his custom-made motorcycle on Wednesday after winning the top prize in the Texas Ranger Limited Edition Silver Series scratch game." $130,000,000 Platinum Payout closes soon, as noted on the Lottery's Web site, www.txlottery.org. The trustee requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
