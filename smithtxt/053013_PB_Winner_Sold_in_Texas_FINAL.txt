TEXAS HAS ITS FIRST POWERBALL® JACKPOT WINNER!
$40 Million winning ticket sold in Northeast Texas!
(AUSTIN) ­ In the tiny Texas town of Bells, one Powerball® ticket was sold that matched all six numbers (9-14-17-49-57, Powerball 2) in last night's drawing for an estimated $40 million. The ticket was sold at the Lone Star Food Store in Bells (located in northeast Texas). This is the first Powerball jackpot-winning ticket sold in Texas since the Texas Lottery® joined the game in 2010. "We look forward to meeting the lucky winner and are excited to have a Powerball jackpot winner in Texas," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "We're equally excited about the revenue Powerball sales have helped generate for the biggest winner of all-- Texas education." More than 18,000 Texans also won lower-tier prizes last night, including one ticket sold in Murphy, Texas that matched five of five numbers, but not the Powerball, good for a $1 million prize. The lucky holder of last night's jackpot-winning ticket chose the cash value option and has 180 days to claim the prize. All jackpot prizes and any prize of more than $1 million must be claimed in person at Texas Lottery Headquarters in Austin. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $21 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $40 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $15 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs, including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance.
