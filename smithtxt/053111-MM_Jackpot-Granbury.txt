FRIDAY'S MEGA MILLIONS® DRAWING YIELDED TEXAS JACKPOT-WINNING TICKET SOLD IN GRANBURY: NO NEWS YET FROM CLAIMANT(S)
(Austin) ­ Last Friday's Mega Millions® drawing produced one $35 million jackpot-winning ticket sold in Granbury. By mid-afternoon Tuesday, no calls from anyone claiming to have the ticket had been received at the Texas Lottery®.

"We are still waiting by the phone for a claimant or claimants to call and make an initial inquiry on this ticket," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The ticket sold in Granbury was purchased with the annuity option and was not a Quick Pick. At the end of the 26 years over which this prize is paid, the ticket holder will have collected the advertised $35 million jackpot. This is the ninth Mega Millions jackpot-winning ticket sold in Texas since we joined the multi-state game in 2003. The last Mega Millions jackpot-winning ticket sold in Texas was in January of 2010 when a ticket worth $144 million was sold in Katy."

The numbers selected in last Friday's drawing were 28-7-5-56-14, and the Mega Ball was 10.

Tommy's #10, 321 S. Morgan, in Granbury sold the ticket. The retailer is now eligible to receive a bonus of $350,000. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $200 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
