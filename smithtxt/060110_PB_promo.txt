POWER PLAY® 10X PROMOTION EXTENDS CHANCE TO WIN
UP TO $2 MILLION AS POWERBALL® REACHES $260 MILLION
(Austin) ­ The estimated $260 million Powerball® drawing for tomorrow is the highest grand/jackpot prize since the game was introduced to Texas Lottery® players on January 31, but players won't need to win it all to claim an impressive prize. An extension of the Power Play® 10X promotion will allow players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prizes up to $2 million. For an extra $1 per play, the Power Play option gives players a chance to increase their nongrand/jackpot prizes by two, three, four or five times. On May 1, the 10X multiplier was added, giving players a chance to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize by ten times. Because the 10X multiplier was not selected during the original promotional period, the promotion will continue until the 10X multiplier is drawn. The attached chart shows the 10X prize amount for each prize level. The Power Play multiplier does not apply to the grand/jackpot prize. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $260 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million.
