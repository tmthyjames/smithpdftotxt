AUSTINITE WINS $2 MILLION ON POWERBALL® TICKET, THE LARGEST POWERBALL PRIZE AWARDED IN TEXAS
(AUSTIN) ­ Jeffrey G. Daly of Austin claimed a $2 million second-tier Powerball® prize today at Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin. By choosing the Power Play® feature, Daly's $1 million second-tier prize doubled to $2 million. Daly's winning ticket matched all five numbers (8 ­ 13 ­ 35 ­ 46 ­ 51), but did not match the Powerball (30) in the drawing held May 19. "My lucky number is `19' that I would use time-to-time," said Daly. "However, I didn't realize it would prove to be lucky as the date of the drawing." Daly says his winnings will help him start a new store with his wife, selling fine-crafted home provisions made locally in Austin. "Mr. Daly's $2 million prize is the largest Powerball prize won by a Texas player since the Texas Lottery joined the Powerball game," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "Hopefully, this will be the first of a long line of large wins by Texas Powerball players." Daly purchased his winning ticket at the Everytime Stop store located at 2105 S. Congress Ave. in Austin. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $164 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $8 million.
