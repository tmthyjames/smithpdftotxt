KWIK PANTRY #101 IN BENAVIDES SELLS THREE SIGNIFICANT PRIZE-WINNING TICKETS IN EIGHT DAYS
(Austin) ­ The last eight days have been notable at the Kwik Pantry #101, 504 E. Main Street, in Benavides. The Texas Lottery® retailer has sold one $35,000 prize-winner, as well as two different scratch-offs each worth $1,000.

Just yesterday, Nora Flores of Benavides spent $3 on one Bonus Cashword ticket and it brought her $35,000. The winner told Lottery officials at the Corpus Christi Claim Center that she was "stunned" to see her prize as she casually scratched the ticket while on the phone with her fiancée. "I'm not sure yet what I'm going to do with my prize money," Flores said. "What I know for sure is that if you don't play, you don't have a chance."

Two other area residents also garnered prizes. Randy Oliveira of Benavides won $1,000 playing Blackjack Showdown, and Armando Lopez of Alice received $1,000 from a Blazing 8's ticket.

"It happens like this sometimes, one store will sell several noteworthy prize-winning tickets in just a matter of days," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Thanks to the 16,000-plus retailer locations across the state that sell Lottery products, we are able to bring entertaining games and significant prizes to our players, and make major contributions to the Foundation School Fund to benefit public education." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $17 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $5 million. Powerball® is an estimated $20 million.
