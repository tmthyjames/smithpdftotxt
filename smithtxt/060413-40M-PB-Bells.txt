RAVENNA PLAYER CLAIMS $40 MILLION POWERBALL®JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ Paul McDowell of Ravenna (located in northeast Texas) visited Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin today to claim the $40 million advertised jackpot from the May 29 Powerball® drawing. McDowell's Quick Pick ticket was the only ticket sold to match all five numbers drawn (9 ­ 14 ­ 17 ­ 49 ­ 57) and the Powerball (2). Since McDowell chose the cash value option, the amount of his prize was $24,906,600, before taxes. This is the first Powerball jackpot claimed in Texas since the Texas Lottery joined the multi-state game in 2010. The claimant purchased his ticket at the Lone Star Food Store #48 located at 205 W. Bells Blvd. in Bells. The store is eligible for a $400,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. The claimant requested minimal publicity. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $21 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $40 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $15 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas.
