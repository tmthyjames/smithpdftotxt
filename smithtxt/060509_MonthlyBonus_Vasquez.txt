LAREDOAN WINS $10,000 PER MONTH FOR 20 YEARS PLAYING THE MONTHLY BONUS SCRATCH GAME FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Oscar Vasquez of Laredo today claimed the top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years playing Monthly Bonus from the Texas Lottery®. His prize will total $2.4 million after the final payment. Vasquez bought his ticket at the Tejano Mart #513, 2705 Arkansas, in Laredo. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. This is the second of four top prizes in this game to be claimed. Early one morning in the last week of May before going out of town, a bleary-eyed Vasquez bought gas and one Monthly Bonus ticket, which he scratched while still in the store parking lot. When he saw the prize, he thought he was imagining it. "I told the clerk in the store that I wasn't sure if I was awake or asleep, and so I handed her the ticket to check for me," Vasquez said. "She saw it and said, `no, sir, you're awake, and you won.'" Vasquez requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $17 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
