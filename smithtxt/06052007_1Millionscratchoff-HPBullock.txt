$50 TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF TICKET WINS FIRST OF SIX $1 MILLION PRIZES
(AUSTIN) ­ After a little less than one month of sales, the first $50 instant ticket from the Texas Lottery® has paid out more than $27 million including break-even prizes. Huey P. Bullock of Odessa became the first of up to six $1 million winners in the $130 Million Spectacular. He wasted no time in deciding where the money would go. "We're going to use the money for education," said Bullock. Asked what he thought of Bullock's plan, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry responded, "An investment in education is an excellent way to use prize money. It is a choice which allows both personal and professional enrichment." The 7-Eleven at 4525 E. University in Odessa, Texas, is eligible to receive $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
