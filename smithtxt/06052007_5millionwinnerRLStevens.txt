FIRST TOP-PRIZE CLAIMED IN GROUND-BREAKING $50 TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Only three weeks after the introduction of the first $50 scratch-off ticket, $130 Million Spectacular, a winner claimed the first of three $5 million top-prizes. The first $1 million prize winner came forward Monday, but five second-tier prizes also remain available. More than 208,000 winning tickets paid out in excess of $16.6 million, including break-even prizes, through May 26. With over 500,000 tickets already sold, the game accounted for 14.5 percent of all instant ticket sales for the week ending May 26. "We are pleased with the sales so far, but the real winner is Texas education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "As always, we encourage our players to enjoy our games responsibly. After all, it's just a game." The Texas Lottery Commission has contributed $9.3 billion dollars to the Foundation School Fund since 1997. Robert L. Stevens, Jr., of Somerset, Texas, claimed the $5 million prize and requested minimum publicity. The Town & Country, located at 1001 4th Ave. in Sterling City, is eligible to receive a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning the ticket. Currently, $130 Million Spectacular is available in approximately 10,500 retailers across the state. (more)
