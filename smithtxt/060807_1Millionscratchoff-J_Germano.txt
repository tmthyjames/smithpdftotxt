$2 TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF TICKET PRIZE LEADS TO $1 MILLION PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Normally content with lower-priced instant tickets, Joyce D. Germano of San Antonio doesn't usually buy the more expensive ones. However, after she won $50 on a $2 ticket recently, she chose to try her luck with the $130 Million Spectacular scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. That $50 purchase garnered a $1 million prize. "I won the $50 and decided to try the new ticket," said Germano. "This is very exciting. I've won before, but not this much." Even payouts of as much as $1,000 in the past didn't prepare her for a big win. She says she hasn't determined how to use the money just yet. The excitement of winning may overshadow her plans right now, but Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry says that's not uncommon. "Many claimants take some time out and let their emotions cool down before settling on the best use for their newfound wealth," said Sadberry. "We encourage our winners to seek out financial and legal advice, if they so choose." Joyce Germano is the third winner of $1 million or more in this game. Two $5 million prizes and four $1 million prizes remain unclaimed. The Mann Chevron, located at 2100 NW Military Highway in San Antonio, is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $34 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million.
