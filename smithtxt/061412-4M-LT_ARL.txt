$4 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT CLAIMED BY AUSTIN TRUST
(AUSTIN) ­ The S.P. Arrow Trust, Nicholas P. Papacharalambous, trustee, of Austin, claimed the Lotto Texas® jackpot prize Friday from the drawing held May 16. The trust selected the Cash Value Option, making the $4 million advertised jackpot worth $3,067,080.00, before taxes. "We feel truly blessed by this good fortune and humbled by the responsibility that comes along with it," said Papacharalambous. The trust's Quick Pick ticket matched all six numbers drawn, 1 ­ 10 ­ 11 ­ 31 ­ 38 ­ 49. For selling the winning ticket, the 7-Eleven Convenience Store #24593 located at 3930 W. Pioneer Parkway in Arlington is eligible for a $40,000 retailer bonus. "I want to congratulate our claimant," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The May 16 Lotto Texas jackpot-winning ticket was the second of two sold in the Metroplex area in less than a week, which just goes to show that you never know when or where your numbers might come up." Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $39 million. Saturday's Powerball ® jackpot is an estimated $40 million, and the Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery® has generated $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $38 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas.
