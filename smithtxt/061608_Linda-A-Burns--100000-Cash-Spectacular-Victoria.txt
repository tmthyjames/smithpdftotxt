ONE `13' BRINGS VICTORIA WOMAN TOP PRIZE IN $100,000 CASH SPECTACULAR SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ The number `13' was working overtime last Friday. The fear-inspiring digit figured prominently in the life of Linda A. Burns of Victoria, who won the top prize in the Texas Lottery® scratch game, $100,000 Cash Spectacular. "At first, I wanted to scream, but nothing came out, and then I just burst out crying when I saw the `lucky' number and the prize that went with it," she said. "I had to show the ticket to my son and ask him if I was right about what I was looking at, which was the prize amount and the number that went with it." The number Burns is referring to is the "13," which appeared in the $10ticket's "winning numbers" box and directly above the $100,000 prize amount. "This ticket is a gift from my son, who also purchased some other tickets," she said. "We've always played together." Her husband was the next to learn of the happy circumstance. "He put the ticket away immediately after I signed it," she said. "I still don't know where he hid it, and I didn't take it to work with me." Burns didn't see the ticket again until she and her husband left the house en route to the Victoria Claim Center to collect the prize. "The number `13' is nothing to be afraid of, as Ms. Burns will attest," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This is the second of the game's nine top prizes to be claimed."

Burns and her husband already had a trip planned for the Father's Day weekend. They went to a Louisiana casino. "My husband wants a Mustang convertible, but I don't know what I think about that yet," she said. "I still can't believe, though, that I collected my prize on Friday the 13th, which I won with the number '13.'" Burns' son bought the ticket at the Fastop Food Store #3, 2103 Lone Tree Road, in Victoria. Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is estimated at $8 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
