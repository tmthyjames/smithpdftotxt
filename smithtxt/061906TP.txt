SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT CLAIMS TOP PRIZE FOR TEXAS LOTTERY® TOP PRIZE $500,000 SCRATCH OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Today Jennifer Gomez claimed the top-cash prize for the Texas Lottery® Top Prize $500,000 scratch game. Gomez will receive $50,000 for the next 10 years, the annuity paid prize totaling $500,000, before taxes. The $1 ticket offers other cash prizes ranging from $1 up to $100. Overall odds of winning any prize in the Top Prize $500,000 game are 1 in 4.67, including break-even prizes. Today's winner makes the second $500,000 prize payout claimed for the game, which leaves three tickets still unclaimed for the top prize.

"I'd also like to remind our players that today's claim is only the second one thus far for the Top Prize $500,000 game so there are still many opportunities to win big." The prize-winning ticket was purchased at Big Diamond, located at 4450 Dezavala Road in San Antonio. The winner has requested minimum publicity.
