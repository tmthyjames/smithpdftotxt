TYLER RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $130 MILLION SPECTACULAR
(AUSTIN) ­Ralph Hilts of Tyler won $50 playing a Texas Lottery® scratch-off ticket, the name of which he couldn't remember. With his $50 prize, he decided he'd buy one $130 Million Spectacular, which costs $50. "I scratched the ticket with a quarter, and I thought to myself that I'd won something," he said. "I asked the clerk to run it through his terminal, and the message came up that the cashing limit had been exceeded." In fact, Hilts presented the print-out that carried that message along with several forms of identification when he came to Lottery headquarters in Austin on Monday to redeem his ticket, just in case that little slip of paper might come in handy. While redeeming his prize of $1 million in Austin, the Lindale Independent School District custodian remained cool. "I'm not going to get excited until I've got the prize in my hands," he said. He wouldn't say much regarding what he might do with his prize after he pays off some bills. "I might buy a Dodge pick-up," he said. "I plan to keep playing, too. I'll buy a few tickets every week, like I do now," he said. "It doesn't pay not to play."

"It's always best to deliberate carefully on how to spend a large prize, as Mr. Hilts is doing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This makes the third of six prizes of $1 million to be claimed in this game." Hilts purchased both tickets at the Scooters #1 Store, located at 5109 Troup Highway in Tyler. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold this ticket. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $11 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $66 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
