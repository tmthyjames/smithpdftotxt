HUNTSVILLE RESIDENT CLAIMS TEXAS LOTTERY WEEKLY GRAND PRIZE; $1,000 PER WEEK FOR 20 YEARS
(AUSTIN) ­ In a surprise arrival at Texas Lottery® headquarters yesterday, Cliff E. Lester of Huntsville became the 76th person to win on one of the most popular scratch games in Texas Lottery history. Lester claimed the $1,000 per week payout for the Texas Lottery Weekly Grand scratch game. "Our scratch games make up a large percentage of our total sales," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "Weekly Grand has been at the top of the list as one the favorites among players since its introduction in 1995. We've released the game a total of 17 times because of our players' response." Weekly Grand offers players the chance to win $1,000 a week for 20 years, totaling $1,040,000, before taxes. Other cash prizes for the $2 game range from $2 up to $300. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.56. Lester purchased his winning ticket at Kroger #357, located at 2222 I-45 North in Conroe. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. Mr. Lester has requested minimal publicity. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org ...
