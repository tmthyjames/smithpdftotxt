NEW CADILLAC® ESCALADETM CASH TICKET OFFERS PLAYERS A CHANCE TO GET GREEN OR GO GREEN
(AUSTIN) ­ The new Cadillac® EscaladeTM Cash game began this week offering Texas Lottery® scratch-off players the chance to win some very "green" prizes, including up to $50,000 cash or one of three Cadillac Escalade Hybrid SUV vehicles with an estimated value of more than $100,000 (including taxes and other fees). Players winning the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid SUV vehicles will have the opportunity to choose certain options for their new vehicles. The vehicles will then be delivered to the Texas Lottery Claim Center nearest each winner. "We've had merchandise prizes in the past, but the Cadillac Escalade stands out," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Not only is it a hybrid and thus more friendly to the environment, it's also made in Texas, and we think that will appeal to many of our players." With more than $20.3 million in total prizes, odds of winning the Cadillac Escalade Cash are one in 3.44, including break-even prizes. Players can win up to ten times per ticket.
