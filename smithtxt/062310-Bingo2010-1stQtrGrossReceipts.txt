CHARITABLE BINGO DISTRIBUTIONS UP IN 2010 1ST QUARTER; GROSS RECEIPTS DOWN SLIGHTLY
(Austin) ­ During the first quarter of 2010, charitable bingo distributions climbed by nearly two percent over the same period in 2009, bringing Texas charities $9.1 million in revenue. Gross receipts were $184.1 million, down by 2.29 percent compared to the same quarter in 2009.

"While there was a slight decline in gross receipts, charitable distributions were up, and that's always good news for Texas charities and non-profits," said Texas Lottery Commission Director of Charitable Bingo, Philip Sanderson. "During the first quarter of 2010, 1,105 charities and nonprofits brought both entertainment and assistance to their communities, thanks to the bingo games they conducted."

There were 32,129 occasions during the first quarter, 971 fewer than in the previous year's first quarter. Players won a total of $134.7 million in prizes, down by 1.85 percent from the same period in 2009.

The charitable bingo division became part of the Texas Lottery Commission in April of 1994.
