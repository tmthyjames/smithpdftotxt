$21,000 WINNER FROM TIVOLI WINS TWICE WITH $2 TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF FAT CAT TRIPLER
(Austin) ­ Cindy Carpenter of Tivoli hadn't planned to buy a Texas Lottery® scratch-off ticket when she walked into the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store #6, 405 Main St. in Tivoli, until the Fat Cat Tripler spoke to her. "I looked at that ticket and something was saying, `Buy me! Buy me!' I bought two and won on both," said Carpenter. One ticket revealed a $4 prize, but the other ticket boasted a $21,000 top prize. "I saw the prize and couldn't believe it. I felt like was going to have a heart attack, and my mouth just dropped open," she said. "I was scared to let go. I had a death grip on that ticket." Still in disbelief, Carpenter took a picture of the ticket and sent it to her sister and boyfriend asking them to confirm what she saw. Then all three went to the Victoria Claim Center together before celebrating with dinner. Carpenter's plans for her prize include using some of the winnings to put a down payment on a new home. "This $21,000 win is only the second of 20 top prizes in Fat Cat Tripler to be claimed," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With more than $10 million in total prizes, it's no wonder this game `spoke' to Ms. Carpenter." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $76 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $63 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, visit www.txlottery.org. ###
