  DENTON RESIDENT WINS TWO PRIZES PLAYING TEXAS TWO STEP® : $7 AND $1 MILLION
(Austin) ­ With two Texas Two Step® playboards for the June 16 drawing, Darrell G Reid of Denton won a $7 prize after hitting one number plus the Bonus Ball number, and then snagged the top prize of $1 million for matching all the numbers drawn. The numbers drawn were 34--24--14--23, and the Bonus Ball was 4. The drawing produced 27,943 prizewinners. Reid bought $5 worth of Quick Picks at the Kroger #493, 500 W. University, in Denton. The $1 million prize makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. The new winner requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow night's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $76 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $63 million.
