TOTAL TEXAS LOTTERY SALES ON THE UPSWING AFTER SLUGGISH TURN AT YEAR'S START
(AUSTIN) ­ A new scratch-off ticket and several high jackpots in two online games have pushed the on-going tally of total Texas Lottery® sales for fiscal year 2007 to a nearly neck-in-neck pace with sales during the same time period last year. "With the introduction in May of the $130 Million Spectacular scratch-off, as well as the April $75 million Lotto Texas jackpot and the record $370 million Mega Millions jackpot in March, total Texas Lottery sales have started to rebound after hitting a plateau in February," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Pick 3 also continues to increase in sales year after year, and Texas Two Step sales are more than five percent above where they were last year at this time. The trend that concerned us has been reversed." In terms of what this means in funding to the state and the Foundation School Fund, in particular, Sadberry says Lottery proceeds are less than one percentage point behind where they were exactly one year ago. "In June of 2006, our proceeds to the state were $797 million," Sadberry said. "Right now, we've delivered $790.2 million, just one-tenth of a percentage point less than last year." Fiscal year 2007 ends on August 31. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
