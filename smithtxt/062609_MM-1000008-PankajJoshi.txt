MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER WINS $1 MILLION ON ONE TICKET PLUS $8 ON THE NEXT
(AUSTIN) ­ Pankaj Joshi of Euless has collected a Mega Millions® prize worth a total of $1,000,008. Joshi bought five play boards on one ticket and megaplied each one. One of them matched five of the six numbers for the May 29 drawing. Another one brought him a prize of $8. "One of Mr. Joshi's tickets turned out to be worth $1million, due to his purchase of the Megaplier option, which brought his prize to $1 million," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "He had another ticket for the same drawing on which he matched the Mega Ball number drawn, and because he had also purchased the Megaplier option for that ticket, his original prize of $2 turned into $8, which explains the unusual prize amount he claimed." Joshi bought his ticket at the Lucky Food Store #2, 902 South Great Southwest Parkway, in Grand Prairie. The numbers drawn for the May 29 game were 23-36-39-30-48, and the Mega Ball number was 34. The new winner selected his numbers. Joshi requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $81 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $18 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
