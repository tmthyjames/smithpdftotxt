IT'S NO JOKE; VICTORIA RESIDENT WINS $30,000 WITH TEXAS LOTTERY® JOKERS WILD BINGO SCRATCH GAME

(AUSTIN) ­ The town of Victoria has had quite a streak lately with Texas Lottery® winners, with Marlisa Townsend claiming her top prize yesterday for the Texas Lottery Jokers Wild Bingo scratch game, $30,000, before taxes. Townsend's claim comes on the heels of last week's winner, Shelvy Cornish, who won $1 million, and Gary Prenzler, who instantly won a Harley-Davidson® Ford F-150 truck earlier this month. "I just couldn't believe it," said Townsend. "I kept looking at the `X' marked on the ticket and thinking it wasn't real. I'm looking at the check and still thinking it can't be real." Townsend purchased her winning ticket at Oak Hill Food, located at Goliad Highway 59 South in Victoria. She told lottery officials she plans to redo her kitchen floors with her winnings.

The Jokers Wild Bingo game allows players the chance to win $30,000, with other cash prizes for the $2 game ranging from $2 up to $1,000. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.21. As of today, there are 10 top prizes left unclaimed for the game. "This month has been quite fortuitous for our Victoria-area lottery players," said Anthony J. Sadberry, acting executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "I would like to congratulate Mrs. Townsend on her win, and let the rest of our players around the state know there are still many more opportunities to win millions of prizes with our Texas Lottery Jokes Wild Bingo game."
