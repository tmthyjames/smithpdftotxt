TRIP TO LAS VEGAS AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT® LIVE GAME SHOW IN THE FUTURE FOR SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT
(Austin) ­Charles L. Winters of San Antonio felt "very special and happy" after learning in a letter from the Texas Lottery® that he had won a trip to Las Vegas in a second-chance drawing in The Price Is Right® scratch-off game. "I've been playing since the Lottery started, so I consider myself a fairly regular player," Winters said. "I don't have a particular method for choosing what games I play, just what feels right. I'll say this, however, you can't win if you don't play." Players who don't win instantly can send in their non-winning tickets for a chance to go to Las Vegas for a special The Price is Right® Live stage show comprised exclusively of Texas Lottery trip winners. In addition to the four-day, three-night trip for each prizewinner and a guest, participants will be randomly selected to sit in Contestants' Row and bid on prizes. Additionally, four randomly selected winners will get a turn at the Big Money Wheel for an opportunity to win prizes from $1,000 to $1 million. "Mr. Winters has won one of our most exciting prizes," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Not only is he going with a guest to be a part of this legendary show, he'll have some cash to spend when he gets there and even after the trip ends. It's the kind of prize many of our players have told us they like to see offered." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $5 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $76 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $105 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
