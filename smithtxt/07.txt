Texas Lottery Looking For A Winner
(Humble, November 28) - - She's Texas' version of the Maytag repair man, poised for action, sitting by a phone that never rings. Tired of waiting in Austin, the Texas Lottery Winner's Liaison traveled to the Humble/Atascocita area today, in hopes of locating the winner of an unclaimed $13 million jackpot. Winner's Liaison Abbie Pina came from lottery headquarters to see if she could find the person who matched all six numbers for the Lotto Texas drawing on June 23. "I'm the one winners talk to when they think they have a winning ticket, and I guide them through the process to claim their millions," Pina said. "I am ready to do my job with this winner." Pina went to the retailer location where the winning ticket was sold, Copperfield Liquor #6, located at 7540 FM 1960 East. Claimants have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim a prize. That clock runs out on this ticket on December 20. "The winner usually comes to us, but this is unusual enough that we thought we'd try to find the winner," said Pina. "I usually hear something within a few weeks of the drawing. This ticket beats the record - it's gone 158 days without anyone stepping forward to claim it. "I want to encourage everyone - before you hang those Christmas lights, search through your wallets, pocketbooks, desks - do an early spring cleaning - see what you can come up with. "If you're the one who bought the ticket at Copperfield on June 23, you could have an early Christmas," said Pina. The only Lotto Texas jackpot ever to go unclaimed was six years ago in April of 1995. The $12.4 million jackpot-winning ticket was purchased in Flower Mound for the drawing held October 26, 1994. The retailer has already received his bonus of $130,000. Tonight's estimated Lotto Texas jackpot is $4 million. -30TV STATIONS - NOTE: There will be a Satellite News Feed of the News Conference from 3:00 -3:15 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, November 28th, at the following coordinates:
