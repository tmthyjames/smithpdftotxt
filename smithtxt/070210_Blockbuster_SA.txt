SAN ANTONIO RETAILER SELLS ANOTHER $1 MILLION PRIZE-WINNER IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­The Fort Sam Chevron, a San Antonio Texas Lottery® retailer, got its second major hit of the year, selling another $1 million second-tier prize-winner in $500,000,000 Blockbuster.

Store owner Chad El-Bayeh was elated at selling the second $1 million-winner in $500,000,000 Blockbuster. He sold the first one in January this year. The store is located at 2207 N. Panamerican Expressway.

"I'm extremely happy and excited that we sold this ticket, especially since I've heard people say that you can't sell a second big prize-winner in the same game after selling the first one," he said. "This proves that you can." "This makes the 20th second-tier prize of the 40 in the game to be claimed in $500,000,000 Blockbuster since it began in May of 2009," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The game also has paid out four of the 10 top prizes of $2.5 million. Mr. El-Bayeh's sale of a second $1 million-winner makes him eligible to receive a second retailer bonus of $10,000 this year."

The prize was claimed by David J. Palmer of San Antonio. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $25 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million, and Powerball® is an estimated $41 million.
