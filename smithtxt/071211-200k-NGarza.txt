PLAYER FROM CHARLOTTE WINS A POWERBALL® TICKET INSTANTLY, THEN WINS $200,000 PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Norma R. Garza of Charlotte has played the Games of Texas for many years and dreamed about winning a large prize. Still, she could hardly believe it when she won $200,000 with a Powerball® ticket received as a prize in the Instant Powerball scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. The Instant Powerball game features more than $20 million in total prizes. One top prize of $100,000 and thousands of other prizes, including more than 150,000 Powerball $5 Quick Pick tickets, remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any Instant Powerball prize are one in 2.80, including break-even prizes. Garza says she was overjoyed when she realized her Quick Pick numbers matched all five numbers 18 ­ 36 ­ 39 ­ 41 ­ 57, but not the Powerball 12, for the June 25 drawing. "I'm going to fix up my house and buy a new truck," she explained. "Powerball may be the newest drawing game in the Texas Lottery family, but it's already become a fun and exciting addition for our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Of course, the big winner remains Texas education. The Texas Lottery has contributed more than $13 billion to the Foundation School Fund since 1997." The H-E-B Food Store #411 located at 219 W. Oaklawn Rd in Pleasanton provided Garza with her winning ticket. (more)
