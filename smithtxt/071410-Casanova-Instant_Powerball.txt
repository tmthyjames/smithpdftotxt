GLADEWATER WOMAN WINS $100,000 PLAYING
TEXAS LOTTERY'S INSTANT POWERBALL® SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­ Jessica Casanova of Gladewater was so elated at winning the top prize of $100,000 in Instant Powerball® that she started crying in the store where she bought her two $5-tickets. Her friends who happen to work at the NewWay KwikStop #1, 227 S. Main Street, where she bought the ticket, scanned it for her. Then they started crying, too.

"This is a big prize, one that will help my fiancée and me plan our wedding for next year and also help us buy a new car," Casanova said. "We've been together for 12 years." Casanova said she's been playing Texas Lottery® games for the last 15 years and has won several prizes of $50 and $100.

"That's what I thought I might win with one of these tickets," she said. "I really enjoy playing, but I don't go broke buying tickets."

"Ms. Casanova has the right attitude about buying tickets, and we're pleased to award this prize to her today," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Instant Powerball officially went on sale just a few weeks ago on June 28. Since then, three of the game's six top prizes have been claimed. The game also features lower-tier prizes beginning at $5,000 down to the break-even $5, as well as a unique $5-worth of Powerball online tickets. It's our top-selling scratch-off game right now." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $16 million, and Powerball is an estimated $20 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $64 million.
