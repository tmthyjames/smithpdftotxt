HEARNE MAN WINS SET FOR LIFE TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Tarrant Boone of Hearne claimed a top prize of $250,000 per year for 20 years (not to exceed $5 million) in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Set For Life. Although Boone claimed the final top prize in the version of the game which was introduced in March of this year, a new Set For Life is already on the market. All three top prizes currently remain unclaimed in that game, which features overall odds of winning any prize of one in 3.96, including break-even prizes. Today's win is good news for Chapmans Fruit Market located at 801 E. Waco Drive in Waco. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. This location has sold a number of winning tickets in the past, including a Lotto Texas® ticket from 1995 worth $18,950,765.95 claimed by Olan R. Sellers of Waco. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $64 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $27 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $17 million.
