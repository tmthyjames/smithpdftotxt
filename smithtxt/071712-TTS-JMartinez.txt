WINNER FROM DEL RIO TRAVELS TO AUSTIN TO CLAIM $1.1 MILLION TEXAS TWO STEP® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Jose Martinez of Del Rio was standing in line at the Pico #3 in Del Rio and noticed the Texas Two Step® jackpot had soared to $1.1 million, its highest level in over three months. He asked for $5 in Quick Pick numbers. That impromptu decision changed his life when he matched all four numbers (1 ­ 9 ­ 21 ­ 31), plus the Bonus Ball (4) for the July 9 drawing. "This is the third time this year that Texas Two Step has climbed over $1 million," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's always exciting when we reach those larger jackpots on a game like Texas Two Step that features improved overall odds of winning." Martinez had hastily written down the winning numbers on the back of an old scratch-off ticket, but when he and his daughter tried to check the ticket they couldn't decide if the Bonus Ball number was a four or 14. "I said, `Let's go to the computer.' The numbers came up right away, and she said, `Dad, you won,'" said Martinez. Although this is his largest win, Martinez says he wins smaller amounts every so often and claims consistency is his key to winning. "I like to keep using the same numbers and then get one or two Quick Picks, too. Sometimes they hit." For selling the winning ticket, the Pico #3 at 811 Las Vacas in Del Rio is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $28 million. Wednesday's Powerball ® jackpot is an estimated $100 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $21 million.
