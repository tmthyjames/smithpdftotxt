H & H TRUST TO TAKE HOME TEXAS' LARGEST MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­ Have you ever wished you didn't have to leave behind a relaxing weekend for a day at work? For the members of the H & H Trust of Dallas, that familiar disquiet led to discovering the $128 million winning Mega Millions ticket in their possession. "We were daydreaming about winning the lottery and taking some time off," said one member of the trust. "We checked the ticket just for fun." Dan Hood, another trust member, decided to go online and check the drawing results, and what he found would justify a long weekend for almost anyone. The numbers were listed: 3, 9, 12, 25, 47, and the Mega Ball 37. Their ticket matched. The group plays Mega Millions regularly, and they have a set of six numbers they use every time, alternating the Mega Ball number. Dan explains, "I play it in a round robin so that I use each of the six numbers as the Mega Ball." As luck would have it, their plan paid off in a big way. This $128 million jackpot set a new record as the largest Mega Millions win in Texas, edging out the winning ticket worth $122 million from the drawing on January 9, 2007. However, it is not the highest jackpot ever won in Texas. That distinction still belongs to the $145 million Lotto Texas win, which occurred on June 19, 2004.

"We congratulate these winners on their record-breaking jackpot," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Obviously they picked the right lucky numbers." When asked about their plans for the money, a trust member responded quickly, "I want to travel!" Of course, a cruise to Alaska or along the Mississippi is more fun than eight hours at the office any day. However, members of the trust also see this as an opportunity to concentrate on volunteer work in the community. Plus, by choosing the annuity option, the winners are guaranteed 26 annual pay days, whether they decide to show up for work or not. Luck also smiled on the Central Gas & More at 7950 Forest Lane in Dallas. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $1 million for selling the winning ticket. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $5 million.
