$18 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT AWARDED; $7 MILLION JACKPOT STILL UNCLAIMED
(AUSTIN) ­ Just one week after the July 11 drawing, Wendell Bell of Allen arrived at the Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to receive his $11,298,389.52 cash value option winnings. However, the clock is still ticking on a $7 million Lotto Texas® jackpot. "We are calling on all players who participated in the April 21 drawing to check their tickets for the winning numbers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "As always, we hope to see the rightful winner come forward before the ticket expires." Records show that the winning ticket was purchased at the Calvert Deli & Grocery located at 1136 S. Virginia St. in Terrell. The winning numbers were 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 47. Players still have time to claim the prize, which is set to expire on October 18 this year. Anyone who thinks they may have the jackpot-winning ticket should call customer service at 1-800-37LOTTO (1-800-375-6886) to verify the ticket information. Mr. Bell requested minimum publicity. QWB, Inc., located at 1302 W. McDermott Drive in Allen sold the $18 million jackpot-winning ticket. As a result, they are eligible to receive a retailer bonus of $189,312.32. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million.
