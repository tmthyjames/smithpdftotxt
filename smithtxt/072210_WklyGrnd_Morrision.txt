EL PASO RESIDENT WINS TOP PRIZE OF $1.04 MILLION IN WEEKLY GRAND
(Austin) ­Cynthia Morrison of El Paso today claimed the top prize of $1,000 per week in the Texas Lottery's Weekly Grand scratch-off game.

The total prize at the end of 20 years is $1,040,000. This is the first of the four top prizes offered in this scratch-off to be claimed.

Morrison was home alone at the time she scratched the last of the five tickets she purchased at the 7-Eleven #606. Since those first exciting moments when she had to take a step back and ask herself out loud if what she was seeing on her ticket was "for real," Morrison has had a chance to catch her breath and think about things. What she knows is that cars are in her immediate future.

"My mother was recently in a car accident, so I'm going to buy her another vehicle," she said. "That's the first thing I'm going to do. The second thing is that I'm also going to take a longoverdue vacation with my husband, daughter and granddaughter."

The store is located at 1733 Brown Street in El Paso. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket.

"Our winner has put family first, helping her mother with a new vehicle and then sharing some quality down time with immediate family members," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the latest version of Weekly Grand on which Ms. Morrison won her prize. The game was issued in May. Three top prizes of a grand per week for 20 years remain."
