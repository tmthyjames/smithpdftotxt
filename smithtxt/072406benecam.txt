PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN FOR TEXAS LOTTERY® PROCEEDS TO BEGIN TODAY
(AUSTIN) ­ "Thanks for Playing," the first-ever Texas Lottery® beneficiary campaign, was launched today to statewide radio, television and print media. The campaign focuses on saluting all of the people that help to support and raise money for Texas schools through playing the Games of Texas. Since 1997, revenue from the sale of Texas Lottery games goes directly to the Foundation School Fund, to help pay for public education in Texas. "More than 60 percent of Texans are unaware that by playing Texas Lottery games they are contributing to the support of public education in the state," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We feel confident that this campaign will increase the public's awareness of our mission to the state. It is something we all feel very good about." Since the first ticket was sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $13 billion for the state of Texas. In fiscal year 2005 (September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005), the Texas Lottery transferred more than $1 billion to the Foundation School Fund. Prior to 1997, lottery proceeds were allocated to the General Revenue Fund. For every dollar Texans spend playing Texas Lottery games, approximately 60 percent is used to pay prizes, 28 percent is transferred to the Foundation School Fund, five percent is paid to retailers, five percent is used for administrative costs and the final two percent (unclaimed prizes) is allocated for other state programs authorized by the Texas Legislature.

The beneficiary campaign was developed with the assistance of DDB Dallas and the Cultura Group. Narration for the state-run spot was done by Ray Benson, 2004 Texas State Musician and leader of Asleep at the Wheel. "Even if you don't win the Texas Lottery, you're a winner for helping Texas schools when you play. I'm honored to help out on this campaign," said Benson.
