INSTANT CASH FIVE SCRATCH-OFF GIVES PRIZE OF FREE CASH FIVE® TICKET THAT BRINGS $26,823 PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ With a prize of a free Cash Five® online ticket that she won after buying one ticket of the new Texas Lottery® scratch-off, Instant Cash Five, Margaret Isaac of Denison wound up the winner of $26,823. "Instant Cash Five is one of our newer instant games and one with a concept that borrows from the popularity of an existing online game, which is Cash Five," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This win is the first from this scratch game to garner a prize from an online game." Isaac bought her Instant Cash Five ticket on the way to work on Tuesday morning and kept the ticket in her purse unscratched until she came home from work that night. She works the late shift as a cashier in the cafeteria of the Tyson's plant in Denison. "I scratched the ticket that night and saw the free Cash Five ticket prize," she said. "I thought it was great to win a free ticket, put it back in my purse and went to bed. The next day on the way to work, I stopped at the store where I usually buy my tickets and turned in my ticket for my free Quick Pick. I put it in my purse and didn't think about it until I got home later." Isaac sent her husband to the Longhorn Convenience Store that night for something. The clerk sent him home with a message to tell his wife to check the ticket she'd gotten that morning because he was sure it had won a prize.

She, however, was way ahead of them, having checked her numbers on the Lottery results shown on KXII-TV, Channel 12, in Sherman. The numbers drawn were 2-12-27-28-33. "Pinch me and wake me up," Isaac told her husband when he got home. "My eyes got really big when I saw those numbers on TV. All I can say is that I'm as happy as I can be, just like my family is really happy for me. This is a real blessing. I might get a new car with this prize money." Isaac had also purchased a 9's In A Line scratch-off that morning. It brought her a prize of $49. The Instant Cash Five ticket retails for $1 and offers a top prize of $1,000. As of Thursday, 61 of the game's 172 top prizes had been claimed. The game was released earlier this month. The Longhorn Convenience Store is located at 7205B Highway 691 in Denison. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the top prize, which is $268.23. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $19 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
