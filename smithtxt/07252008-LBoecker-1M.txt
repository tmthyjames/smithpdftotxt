MAGNIFICENT MILLIONS MINTS THREE NEW MILLIONAIRES IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS
(AUSTIN) ­ Since its introduction on May 26, three Texas residents have claimed $1 million prizes playing the Magnificent Millions scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. Yesterday's winner, Linda Boecker of Houston, validated her ticket in the Houston Claim Center under a new rule allowing prizes up to $1 million to be claimed at the regional offices. Boecker purchased her winning ticket from the Sage Food Mart located at 5201 Richmond Ave in Houston, qualifying that location for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Seven top prizes remain in the $20 game, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.08, including break-even prizes. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $19 million.
