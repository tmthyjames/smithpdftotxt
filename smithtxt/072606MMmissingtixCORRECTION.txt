DEADLINE NEARS TO CLAIM $750,000 MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE -CORRECTION- DEADLINE DATE AND TIME
(AUSTIN) ­ A Mega Millions® ticket purchased in McAllen for the February 7, 2006, drawing correctly matched the first five numbers for the drawing, but no one has turned the ticket over for validation and the deadline to claim the prize is fast approaching. Come 5 p.m., on Friday, August 4, the clock will stop for anyone to claim the $750,000 prize and it will be transferred to the state's General Fund. "We're hoping someone will come forward soon," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We urge players to look carefully for any Mega Millions tickets they may have held onto, and review the numbers to see if the ticket is the correct one for this prize." The numbers drawn for the February drawing were: 2 ­ 16 ­ 25 ­ 30 ­ 48 and the Mega Ball number was 26. The Megaplier® number was 3. The secondtier prize, $250,000, is won by matching the first five numbers, but not the Mega Ball. Because the ticket buyer also chose to Megaply the prize amount, the ticket is actually worth $750,000. The ticket was purchased at Circle K #7326 at 200 East Hwy 83.
