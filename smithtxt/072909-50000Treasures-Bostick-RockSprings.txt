ROCKSPRINGS RESIDENT WINS $50,000 TOP PRIZE PLAYING $50,000 TREASURES
(AUSTIN) ­Nancy Bostick was in Leakey last week on business and it turned out to be more profitable than she could've imagined because she won $50,000 with a Texas Lottery® ticket, $50,000 Treasures. Bostick was all over the map last week, going from Rocksprings to Leakey and then to Cuero this weekend to visit her ailing sister. Monday she was in Victoria to claim her $50,000 prize at the Texas Lottery Claim Center. This also is not her first visit to a Lottery claim center. "I won a prize package in the baseball scratch game, and I've won some cash prizes before, but nothing like this," she said. "This prize kept me up all night last Thursday. I've been so excited about winning this money that I had to sleep with the ticket on the pillow right next to me. Then I'd put it in my purse after I woke up." Bostick said her road to the Lottery claim center in Victoria began when her husband sent her a "money-angel" email, the kind that the receiver is supposed to send to others to generate good luck for the recipient and the sender.

"I never send those things on when I get them, but I sent this one, and I can't tell you why," she said. "Well, from now on, I'll be forwarding those when I get them. It's by the grace of God that I won this prize. What a gift." Now that she's collected her prize, Bostick says she's not sure what she'll do with it. "I'll put most of it away for a rainy day," she said. "I'll spend a little bit of it, but I'm not sure on what yet. Maybe I'll go to a casino in Louisiana, just for fun." "$50,000 Treasures is a five-dollar game that's been popular with our players," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the fifth of the seven top prizes that the game offers to be claimed." Bostick bought her four tickets at the Fuel City Texaco, 844 US Highway 83 South, in Leakey. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million.
