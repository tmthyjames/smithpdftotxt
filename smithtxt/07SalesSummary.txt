TEXAS LOTTERY® TRANSFERS TO THE STATE EXCEED $1 BILLION FOR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR
(AUSTIN) ­The Texas Lottery® reported today that transfers to the Foundation School Fund for Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 exceeded $1 billion, making this the sixth consecutive year in which transfers grew. Transfers increased to $1.031 billion versus $1.029 billion for FY 2006. "Since Fiscal Year 1998, Texas Lottery proceeds have been dedicated to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This is the fourth consecutive year that proceeds from the sale of lottery products have contributed more than $1 billion to the Foundation School Fund. This is a job we are proud to do in partnership with our 16,000-plus retailers." Total sales for FY 07 were $3.774 billion. Among the year's highlights, the Texas Lottery introduced the first $50 scratch-off game in North America, $130 Million Spectacular, and experienced a record Mega Millions® jackpot of $370 million in March. "The $50 scratch-off game is an excellent example of the actions taken by the agency to respond to players' feedback on products they would like to see," said Sadberry. "Since its introduction in May, the $130 Million Spectacular has paid out more than $70 million in prizes. In addition, the record Mega Millions jackpot brought great excitement to our players." For the year, instant tickets produced sales of $2.8 billion, and Lotto Texas® generated sales of $232.5 million. Mega Millions, the multi-state jackpot game, brought in sales of $192.5 million.

additional $44.3 million in sales. Cash 5® sales were $86.3 million, and Texas Two Step® posted sales of $48.4 million. The Pick 3TM game continued to grow for the 13th year in a row with sales exceeding $312.7 million. "Pick 3 may not get the same attention as Lotto Texas or Mega Millions," said Sadberry. "But Pick 3 players are loyal and the game has attracted more fans every year." Building on the popularity of Pick 3, the Texas Lottery will launch a new game, Daily 4TM, on September 30. Although it includes some features similar to Pick 3, Daily 4 also incorporates unique play styles and a new add-on game feature, Sum It UpTM, both of which are expected to appeal to new players. The Foundation School Fund was not the only beneficiary of the Texas Lottery in the past year. Texas Lottery retailers received more than $188 million in commissions and over $4 million in bonuses during FY 2007. Additionally, Texas Lottery players received more than 2.3 billion in prizes during the year.
