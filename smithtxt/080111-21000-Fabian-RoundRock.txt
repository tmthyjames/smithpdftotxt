ROUND ROCK RESIDENT GETTING IN BED WITH $21,000 SCRATCH-OFF CASH CLAIMED AT TEXAS LOTTERY® HQ
(Austin) ­Carol Fabian of Round Rock decided to enjoy her $21,000 Fat Cat Tripler top prize by taking a cue from a certain raven-haired Hollywood mega-star who reveled on bucket-loads of cash strewn across her bed in a big-screen melodrama from 1993. "I'm so happy that I'm going to cover my bed with this money and throw myself on it," Fabian said. "I'm still in shock over winning, but not so much that I don't know that throwing myself on this cash is exactly what I'm going to do." Fabian did this very thing once before, she said. "I won $6,000 at a casino. Believe me, it's really fun." Additionally, Fabian says she has some things to take care of with her prize. "I'm going to pay off my car first, give my kids some cash and then bank the rest. I'm taking my kids to dinner at the Olive Garden tonight." "Fat Cat Tripler came out early this summer," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "This $2 game gives players odds of one in 4.45 of winning any prize, including the break-even prize, as well as 20 top prizes of $21,000. Ms. Fabian's prize is the eighth of those to be claimed." Fabian says she loves playing scratch-offs. "I prefer games like Fat Cat Tripler," she said. "A $2 game like this one has the kind of exciting prizes I like, and I think my chances of winning are pretty good. I've won several hundred on other games that cost $1, $2 and $5." (more)
