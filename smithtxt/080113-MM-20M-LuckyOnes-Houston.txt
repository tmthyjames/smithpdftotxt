(AUSTIN) ­ The Lucky Ones Partnership represented by Susan Horton, General Partner, of Houston, travelled to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin today to claim the $13,221,900 cash value of an advertised $20 million Mega Millions® jackpot. The partnership's ticket was the only one to match all of the numbers drawn on July 16. The winning numbers were 10-14-21-40-53, Mega Ball 20. The ticket was sold at the Rosslyn Food Mart located at 9245 N. Houston Rosslyn Road in Houston. This makes the store eligible for a $190,000 retailer bonus. Texas has had nine other Mega Millions jackpot prize winners. Mega Millions players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 56, plus the Mega Ball number from a field of 46. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,711,536, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 40. "We are excited to welcome the Lucky Ones Partnership as our latest Mega Millions winners, but they weren't the only big winners in July. A Quick Pick ticket sold in Laredo won last night's Lotto Texas jackpot," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. One ticket matched all of the numbers drawn, 21-23-29-44-47-53, in the Lotto Texas® drawing held July 31. The purchaser selected the cash value option for the $19 million advertised jackpot.
