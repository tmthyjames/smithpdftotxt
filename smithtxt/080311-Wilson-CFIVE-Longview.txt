WITH BIRTH DATES AND FAMILY MEMBERS' AGES, LONGVIEW RESIDENT WINS CASH FIVE® TOP PRIZE
(Austin) ­Jerry Wilson of Longview depended on numbers he knew well when he penciled in his Cash Five® ticket. The numbers he chose, the birth dates and ages of his immediate family, served him well, bringing him the top prize of $22,064 in Monday night's Cash Five drawing. "This is money that I can share with my family and also save for my son's college expenses," Wilson said. "Birth dates and family members' ages have always been popular for players who enjoy choosing their numbers as they buy online tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Because the Texas Lottery's mission is to generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas, it's especially fitting that Mr. Wilson will use part of this prize to help with his son's college expenses." Wilson purchased the ticket at the EZ Mart #443, 1910 Judson, in Longview. The retailer is eligible for a bonus equal to one percent of the top prize, $220.64. The numbers drawn were 829-9-16-5. "I've been playing the lottery since it started," Wilson said. "I play responsibly and use common sense with the money I've won. I feel very happy and blessed to have won this prize." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $160 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $99 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
