MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE CLAIMED; $750,000 PAID TO MONTERREY RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Speculation ended this week over a missing Mega Millions® ticket worth $750,000. Rodolfo Dufour of Monterrey turned the ticket over for validation to lottery officials in time to collect the prize from the February 7 drawing. Dufour's ticket matched the first five numbers, but not the Mega Ball, for the drawing. According to his statement, Dufour was notified by family members of a sign posted at the selling retailer regarding the missing ticket. He wrote that he was very happy about his win and that he plans to put the money in his bank. "Mr. Dufour really let the clock tick down on this ticket," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "This was the final week in which a player could turn the ticket over and collect the $750,000 prize." Players have 180 days from the date of a drawing to collect prizes for Cash Five®, Pick 3TM, Texas Two Step®, Lotto Texas® and Mega Millions. Dufour's ticket was set to expire at the close of business today (5 p.m.). Since Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, three tickets sold in the Valley area worth $5,000 or more have gone unclaimed. A ticket worth $5,000 was sold in Harlingen and tickets worth $5,000 and $175,000 were sold in Brownsville. "Unclaimed prize money is transferred to the state," explained Sadberry. "Last fiscal year, we transferred more than $60 million to such programs as UTMB in Galveston, Health and Human Services Commission's graduate student program and the remainder to the state's General Revenue Fund."
