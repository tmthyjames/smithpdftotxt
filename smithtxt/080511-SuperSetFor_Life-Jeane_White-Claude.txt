SUPER SET FOR LIFE TOP PRIZE WINNER COLLECTS $7.5 MILLION AT TEXAS LOTTERY® HQ IN AUSTIN
(Austin) ­ Jeane White of Claude managed to loosen her grip on her purse just long enough today to turn over a Super Set For Life scratch-off to Texas Lottery® officials so they could let her claim the $7.5 million prize the ticket carried. "I seriously thought about keeping this ticket in the freezer, because what better place for a ticket in case of a fire, but decided instead on my purse," she said. "It's been glued to me since Tuesday." White bought the ticket at the Taylor Petroleum Companies Inc., 5000 I-40 East, in Amarillo. The retailer is now eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this top-prize-winning ticket. "We released this version of Super Set For Life in July of 2010," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mrs. White claimed the third of the four top prizes in this game, which will be paid out at $500,000 per year for 15 years." The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $99 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $16 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $180 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
