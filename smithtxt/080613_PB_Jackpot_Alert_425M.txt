JACKPOT ALERT: WEDNESDAY'S POWERBALL® JACKPOT AT $425 MILLION

(AUSTIN) ­ Tomorrow night's Powerball® jackpot has been increased to an estimated $425 million, the largest lottery jackpot currently up for grabs in the U.S. The third largest Powerball jackpot ever, and the fourth largest jackpot in history for any lottery game. This jackpot started as a $40 million prize on June 26 and is the result of 12 draws without a jackpot winner. Powerball players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 59, plus the Powerball number from a field of 35. The second-tier prize, awarded for matching all five numbers, but not the Powerball number is $1 million. Players can increase their second-tier prize to $2 million if they purchase the $1 add-on feature Power Play with their ticket. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 32.
