BISHOP RESIDENT WINS TOP PRIZE OF $3 MILLION IN MILLIONS & MILLIONS FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Joan R. Ginther of Bishop today claimed the $3 million top prize in Millions & Millions, a scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. She purchased the ticket at the Times Market 2005, 525 Highway 77 Bypass, in Bishop. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this top-prize-winning ticket. "This is not Ms. Ginther's first visit to Lottery headquarters in Austin," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "She won a share of an $11 million Lotto Texas jackpot in July of 1993, as well as a top prize of $2 million in the Holiday Millionaire scratch-off game in 2006. Her claim today is also a first for us. We've searched our databases and found no one else who has won two top prizes in excess of $1 million, as well as a Lotto Texas jackpot." Ginther claimed the second of the four top prizes offered in this game. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $24 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
