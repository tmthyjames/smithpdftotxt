(AUSTIN) ­ Ricky Henderson of Tyler claimed the last of four $1 million top prizes in the Maximum Millions scratch-off game at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler on Monday. "I don't think it really hit me when I first scratched off the ticket," said Henderson. "It finally sank in when they gave me the check and now I'm really excited!" Henderson, a single father, is a longtime Texas Lottery player and said he plans to use some of his winnings to buy homes for himself and his mother, and to invest a large portion for his daughter's future. The winning ticket was purchased at the D & N Grocery store located at 1007 W. Bow St. in Tyler. The retailer is eligible to receive a $10,000 bonus. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $21 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $212 million and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $6 million.
