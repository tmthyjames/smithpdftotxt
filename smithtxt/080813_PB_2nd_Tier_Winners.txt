TEXAS HAS FOUR NEW POWERBALL® MILLIONAIRES
Tickets matching five numbers for last night's drawing sold in Arlington, Amarillo, Mount Pleasant and San Antonio (AUSTIN) ­ Four Texas cities have new millionaires today with tickets matching five of the numbers drawn in last night's Powerball® drawing being sold by local retailers. Second-tier prize winning tickets were sold in Arlington, Amarillo, Mount Pleasant and San Antonio.

"We look forward to meeting Texas' newest Powerball millionaires," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. "In addition to last night's winners, Texas has had 26 other lottery players become millionaires by winning second-tier prizes this past year."

Powerball players win second-tier prizes of $1 million by matching five of the numbers drawn but not the red Powerball. By adding the Power Play® feature for $1 at the time of purchase, players double their second-prize win to $2 million.
