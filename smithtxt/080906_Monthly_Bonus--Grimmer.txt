SPRING TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER WINS TOP PRIZE PLAYING MONTHLY BONUS
(AUSTIN) ­ Richard Grimmer of Spring this week claimed the top prize in the Texas Lottery® Monthly Bonus scratch-off game, which, for the next 20 years, will bring him $10,000 per month. Grimmer purchased the $5 Monthly Bonus ticket at the Save-A-Step Mart, located at 21950 Meadowhill Drive in Spring. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. "This is the kind of prize everybody wants to win," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Just like the game's name says, every month Mr. Grimmer will receive a piece of the prize that, at the end of 20 years, will total $2.4 million." Monthly Bonus has one top prize remaining.
