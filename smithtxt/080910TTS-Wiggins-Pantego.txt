FOR TEXAS TWO STEP® WINNER OF $675,000, PRIZE AFFORDS CHANCE TO HELP FAMILY
(Austin) ­Travis Wiggins of Arlington said the first thing he'll do with his Texas Two Step® prize of $675,000 from the drawing last Thursday is help out his son and daughter.

"My son recently lost his job, so my wife and I want to help him out, as well as my daughter," Wiggins said. "After that, I've got two other things to do, and that'll be that."

Wiggins is referring to saying good-bye to his mortgage and saying hello to a new car.

"Once I pay off the house, and that will happen very soon, I'm going car-shopping," he said. "I've always had Chevrolets, but I'm going to get something different this time, something sportier."

He's no stranger to winning, either. Last October, Wiggins won a prize of more than $24,000 playing Cash Five®. "I prefer playing the online games, and I like to play them all," he said. On top of the happy circumstance of winning a second significant prize from the Texas Lottery® is the coincidence of buying this ticket at the same store that sold him the winning Cash Five ticket last October, the Circle D Food Mart, 3601 W. Pioneer Parkway, in Pantego. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $6,750.

"We are excited to hear about Mr. Wiggins' plans for his winnings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We're pleased for our retailer, too, who sold two significant prize-winning tickets in less than one year. Thanks in large part to our retailers, the Texas Lottery is one of the most successful lotteries in the country." (more)

The new winner selected his numbers. Those were 9-18-19-33, and the Bonus Ball was 7. The total number of winners in last Thursday's Texas Two Step drawing was 20,357.

"My wife and I are both disabled," he said. "Once I do what I've set out to do, this prize will take care of us. I'm very grateful." Wiggins said he has a lot to celebrate, not the least of which is his 44th wedding anniversary next December. "Lots of people don't get to 44 years of marriage, but I guess I got lucky there, too." Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is $200,000. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $64 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $6 million, and Powerball® is an estimated $38 million.
