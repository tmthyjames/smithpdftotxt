MEGA JUMBO BUCKS III WINNER CLAIMS PRIZE OF $1 MILLION IN FIRST SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­Travis Delacerda of Beaumont has collected a prize of a cool $1 million, the top prize in the first of four second-chance drawings in Mega Jumbo Bucks III. He entered the drawing by mailing in his non-winning tickets.

"I thought someone at work was playing a joke on me when I got the call from the man at the Lottery," Delacerda said. "But when he started walking me through the website, I thought he was on the level. I called the Lottery back to confirm the phone call and the operator connected me to him, so I knew it was real."

He plans to use his winnings to pay off his mortgage and buy a new vehicle, but he and his wife say the most important thing is making sure their kids' future is secure.

"The most I've ever won is $500," Delacerda said. "But like I've always told people, you've got to buy tickets if you want to win."

"Mega Jumbo Bucks III is a part of our three-game Jumbo Bucks suite issued back in May," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Each game in the suite is offered at a different price point with different top prizes and some very significant prizes in the second-chance drawings. This $10-game offers 12 top prizes of $250,000, and a total of more than $85 million in lower-tier prizes. For players like Mr. Delacerda who have non-winning tickets, there's still a chance to win big by entering those tickets in the second-chance drawings. This second-chance drawing also gave 100 winners a prize of $1,000 each."
