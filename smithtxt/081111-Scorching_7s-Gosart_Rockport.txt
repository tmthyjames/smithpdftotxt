H-E-B EMPLOYEE IN ROCKPORT GOES TO LUNCH, BUYS A SCORCHING 7's SCRATCH-OFF, WINS $77,777
(Austin) ­Kim E. Gosart took her lunch break at work and did what she often does, which is to buy a Texas Lottery® ticket at the instant ticket vending machine (ITVM), and spend part of her free time scratching the ticket. This time, there was a prize of $77,777 under her Scorching 7's scratch-off. "Whenever I feel like buying a ticket, I get one during my lunch hour," Gosart said. "I couldn't believe it was a winner until it was validated at the claim center. I'm going to save it all for a while, until I figure out what to do with it." "Scorching 7's came out last June with six top prizes of $77,777," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Ms. Gosart's top prize is the fourth of those to be claimed." The ticket came from the ITVM located in the H-E-B Food Store #562, 1409 Highway 35 North Business, in Rockport. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $18 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
