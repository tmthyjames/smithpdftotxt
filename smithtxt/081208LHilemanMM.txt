FORT WORTH MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER WINS $1 MILLION PRIZE WITH MEGAPLIER® OPTION
(AUSTIN) ­ Lari J. Hileman of Fort Worth claimed a $1 million Mega Millions® prize from the Texas Lottery® yesterday. By matching the numbers 17 ­ 29 ­ 36 ­ 53 ­ 55, but not the Mega Ball, 26, from the July 18 drawing, the ticket became eligible for a second-tier prize of $250,000. However, Hileman's decision to Megaply® quadrupled that prize. Hileman purchased the winning ticket as a Quick Pick from the Express Mart #2, located at 5400 South Hulen in Fort Worth. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $56 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $25 million.
