TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFFS BRING EAST TEXANS PRIZES OF $50,000 AND $33,000
(AUSTIN) ­ Two East Texans have each won the top prize in different Texas Lottery® scratch-off games. Lotería® Texas brought William I. Webb of Longview $33,000, and Indiana JonesTM gave Haley Turner of Mabank $50,000. "I was on my way to a party, stopped for gas and bought an Indiana Jones scratch-off, but put it away in my purse," Turner said. "Much later, I finally scratched the ticket and it said `$50,000.'" The Indiana JonesTM game was issued in April, prior to the premiere of the film featuring the character of the adventurous archeologist portrayed by actor Harrison Ford. With this win, six of the game's seven top prizes of $50,000 have now been claimed. Of the game's 20 second-tier prizes of $5,000, 15 have already been claimed. She purchased the ticket at the Gateway #5 convenience store, 521 N. 3rd Street in Mabank. William Webb also made a fortuitous stop for gas at the Food Fast/Short Stop 24, 2851 N. Eastman Road in Longview. The colorful ticket that he took home was Lotería® Texas. His prize of $33,000 is the eighth to be claimed of the 20 top prizes the game offers.
