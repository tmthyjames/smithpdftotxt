HOUSTON TRUST WINS $1,000 PER WEEK FOR 20 YEARS PLAYING WEEKLY GRAND SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­The Evereze Revocable Trust, Everardo H. Martinez, Trustee, of Houston won the top prize of $1,000 per week for 20 years with a Weekly Grand scratch-off. The prize will not exceed $1,040,000. After mowing the lawn and getting the back yard ready for a family barbecue, Martinez dropped by the Allen Genoa C-Store, 634 Allen Genoa Road, in Houston to buy ice. With the $4 in change he had left, he bought two scratch-offs, one Break The Bank and the Weekly Grand that brought him the prize. "My wife and I plan to use this money to help our children go to college, that's the most important thing," Martinez said. "We also plan to buy a new home." "It's great to learn that this prize will go first and foremost toward helping the trustee's children plan and prepare to go to college," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the last of the four top prizes offered in this version of Weekly Grand to be claimed. With no top prizes left, game-closing procedures will now be initiated." The winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $18 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
