AMARILLO RESIDENT CLAIMS $2 MILLION

POWERBALL® PRIZE FROM AUG. 7 DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ Donald Bjork of Amarillo matched all of the numbers drawn (5 ­ 25 ­ 30 ­ 58 ­ 59) except the Powerball (32) for a $2 million second-tier win in the Powerball® drawing held Aug. 7. Because he selected the Power Play® option for an extra $1 at the time of purchase, the second-tier prize automatically increased to $2 million. The $425 million advertised Powerball jackpot for Aug. 7 ultimately rose to $448.4 million based on sales. Two tickets in New Jersey and one in Minnesota matched all five numbers plus the Powerball for a share of the jackpot prize. Bjork, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his winning ticket at the Toot'N Totum #82 located at 5900 Coulter St. in Amarillo. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $21 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $41 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $15 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas.
