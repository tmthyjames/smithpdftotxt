JUNE LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT PRIZE CLAIMED; $15 MILLION PAID TO LEGAL ENTITY FROM COPPELL
(AUSTIN) ­ Our Aurora Capital, Ltd., Our Aurora Management, LLC, General Partner, by Lawrence J. Meddaugh, president, of Coppell, on Friday claimed a Cash Value Option prize of $15,053,739.22 for the June 28 Lotto Texas® jackpot drawing. The advertised jackpot was $26 million. The ticket that matched the numbers drawn was a Quick Pick and was purchased at the Express Lane, 1985 West NW Highway, in Dallas. The numbers drawn were 8-19-22-31-41-43. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, which comes to $260,000. "The Cash Value Option has been one of the most popular features that we've ever offered players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Players must choose the CVO or the 25 annual payments at the time of purchase. Since February, 1997, when we first made the Cash Value Option available, it's become more popular with Lotto Texas players than the annual-payment choice. It's been chosen by a margin of 71 percent to 29 percent in the 232 jackpots we've had since then." The representative of the entity claiming the jackpot requested minimal publicity. Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $49 million and Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $22 million.
