LUCKY DAY FOR TYLER SCRATCHSCRATCH-OFF PLAYER Wins $1.04 $1.04 Million Weekly Grand Top Prize
(AUSTIN) ­ Until last Sunday, longtime Texas Lottery® player Bernardo Orozco had always limited his purchases to Monday through Saturday. After church, Orozco decided to change up his routine and now he has more than a million reasons to be glad he did. Orozco visited Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin on Tuesday to claim a top prize of $1.04 million in the Weekly Grand scratch-off game. Orozco will receive $1,000 per week for the next 20 years. "I always feel good when I buy Texas Lottery tickets because I know that the money goes to help good causes," said Orozco. "But to win a prize like this is an incredible blessing for me and my family, and I am very grateful." Orozco said he plans to donate some of his winnings to his church and is planning to buy a new house. He also said he'll keep buying his tickets on Sundays. "You never know when your lucky day will come until it happens," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "I want to congratulate Mr. Orozco for finding his." Orozco purchased his ticket at the Panaderia De Leon located at 323 N. Beckham Ave. in Tyler. The retailer is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $38 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed more than $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
