IT'S BACK! SALES RESUME FOR THE TEXAS LOTTERY'S® ALL OR NOTHINGTM GAME
(AUSTIN) - The Texas Lottery® today announced that sales for its popular All or NothingTM game will resume on Sunday, Aug. 25 and drawings for the game will begin on Monday, Aug. 26 at 10 a.m. (CDT).

All or Nothing is played by selecting 12 numbers from a pool of 24. Players can win the game's top prize of $250,000 by matching all of the 12 numbers drawn or by matching none of the 12 numbers drawn. In addition to a $250,000 top prize, All or Nothing also offers lower-tier prizes of $2, $10, $50, and $500, depending on how many numbers the player does or does not match.

The Texas Lottery temporarily stopped sales for All or Nothing on June 3 to address a game design issue that created the possibility of unexpected financial liability should an unrealistic number of winners occur for a single drawing. Now, for any drawing where the number of top prize winning plays is greater than 20, the top prize will be paid on a pari-mutuel rather than a fixed prize basis, and a liability cap of $5 million will be divided equally by the number of top prize winning plays. For instance, if there are 30 top prize winning plays, each winning play will be eligible for $166,666 as the top prize payment amount.

"We anticipate that Texas Lottery players will welcome back All or Nothing's unique play style with the same enthusiasm the game saw in its first eight months of sales," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "The game's previous performance exceeded expectations, generating $62.5 million in sales and $36.7 million in prizes to players."
