NEW PAIR OF GLASSES FIRST PURCHASE FOR MEGA

JUMBO BUCKS III TOP PRIZE WINNER FROM DAINGERFIELD
(Austin) ­Larry Applegate of Daingerfield's first purchase with his $250,000 top prize from the Texas Lottery® scratch-off Mega Jumbo Bucks III may be a new pair of glasses. It wouldn't be a bad investment. "I had a hard time seeing what the scratch-off said, and I almost threw it away," Applegate said. "Then, I got a good look at it, or thought I had, and believed I had won $25,000. The store clerk had to tell me what was on it. I'm going to buy some new glasses real soon." Applegate buys his tickets every Saturday at the same place, the Shop-N-Go, 530 N. Main Street, in Lone Star. The Saturday he won this prize also brought him another, and it was not in Texas. "I was in Shreveport with my family that same night and won $9,000 at a casino," he said. "I guess it was just my day, and I feel very blessed." The new winner says he plans to bank most of his prize. "I'll use some of it to get out of debt, and a little bit to take my wife and me on a vacation to Montana to visit our nephew. The rest is getting put away." "This isn't the first time a winner tells us they mistakenly thought they had won a prize less than what it really was, and it's always a happy surprise when they find out their prize is larger than they had expected," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Four top prizes of $250,000 in Mega Jumbo Bucks III remain unclaimed." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $21 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $47 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $14 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is available on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
