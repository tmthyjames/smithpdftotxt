CARROLLTON MAN COLLECTS $1 MILLION 2ND-TIER PRIZE IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER
(AUSTIN) ­David M. Brophy of Carrollton has always managed to stay ahead of his Texas Lottery® purchases, but his most recent win put him way up in the "plus" column. "I've won $200 several times recently, and in the past I've won a little bit of money," he said. "But this, well, I wasn't expecting to win $1 million." Brophy said he had gone to the Quiktrip #930, located at 1528 Hebron Parkway West in Carrollton, to make his weekly Saturday purchase. "I scratched the ticket in the car," he said. "I kept waiting for the decimal point to move. I tried to remain calm, went back into the store and asked them to scan the ticket. When the machine said that I needed to go the claim center, then I knew I had a winner." Since he bought the ticket during the first part of the weekend, Brophy said he spent the rest of his weekend nervously appraising his ticket and taking care of a few practical matters. "It definitely turned into a long weekend," he said. "I was sleepdeprived, but I did put my will together. It was certainly a good weekend."

What Brophy meant by saying that it had been a "good weekend" was that the $1-million prize wasn't the only one he won that Saturday. "I won $100 playing Set For Life," he said. "I gave that ticket to a friend who could use the cash." As far as his immediate plans for his prize, Brophy said he plans to create a trust fund for his great nephew. The Carrollton businessman is a broker for a men's-gifts company and travels throughout an eight-state district. "I buy tickets wherever I am," he said. "This one, though, is going to be my favorite ticket, my BFF, until I win something more." "Like Mr. Brophy, many of our players have really enjoyed the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game this summer," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Of the 40 2nd-tier prizes of $1 million in the game, eight have been claimed, and among them is Mr. Brophy's." Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
