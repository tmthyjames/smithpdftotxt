FORT WORTH WOMAN WINS TOP PRIZE IN $250,000 BINGO FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Cristina Trice of Fort Worth is often called the "Lucky Lady" by the retailer who sells her Texas Lottery® tickets because she sometimes wins lower-tier scratch-off prizes. She proved him right once again, this time by winning $250,000 playing $250,000 Bingo. "This game has been great for me," Trice said. "I've won $500 twice on this ticket, as well as smaller prizes of $50 and $10 several times. As for the `Lucky Lady,' I think that came from the fact that I won $1,000 on another ticket earlier this year." Trice bought her lone ticket yesterday at her usual retailer on her way home from work at a local hospital. "As I was getting ready to scratch the ticket at home, I was wondering to myself why I never seem to win the big prize, the top one," she said. "All of a sudden, there it was, the big one, the top prize, and all I could say was, `I don't believe it, I don't believe it.'" The Cozumel, Mexico, native called her brother to give him the news, who essentially told her not to count her chickens before they hatch. "He kept telling me not to be too excited yet, at least not until I checked with the Lottery about the ticket," she said. "He's the only one I told, but now that I've been to the claim center in Fort Worth, I can call my mother and give her the news."

Several years ago Trice and her husband won $5,000 in Las Vegas, which they used to buy a car. "I plan to trade in the one I have for another one, not necessarily this year's model, but maybe a 2006 or 2007 car," she said. "Also, this stroke of good luck has me thinking about buying a home." "$250,000 Bingo offers five prizes of a quarter of a million dollars," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the second of those to be claimed." Trice bought the ticket at the Diamond Famous Fried Chicken, 2712 Las Vegas Trail, in Fort Worth. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million, and tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million.
