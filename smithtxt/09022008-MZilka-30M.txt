LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT WINNER FROM WACO MAKES THE CASE FOR CHECKING TICKETS TWICE
(AUSTIN) ­ After hearing about the Lotto Texas® jackpot-winning ticket sold at the E Z Shop, Merri Zilka of Waco knew she had to check her ticket, but the numbers listed on the Texas Lottery® Web site just didn't match those on the ticket in front of her. Luckily, Zilka decided to double-check her recent tickets again when she went to the E Z Shop on Sunday. Only then did she realize that she'd been looking at the wrong ticket all along. A store clerk pointed out that her ticket for the August 27 drawing, advertised at $30 million, matched all six numbers, 5 ­ 8 ­ 15 ­ 25 ­ 40 ­ 53. The Cash Value Option prize is $19,433,607.40, before taxes. "God just answered my prayers. It's that simple," said Zilka. She went home and calmly told her husband of 40 years to ask for Tuesday off so he could accompany her to claim the prize. After all, he helped pick the lucky numbers. "We've been sharing the load," Zilka explained. "One of us would stay calm while the other would go berserk." Born and raised in the Waco area, Zilka expects to give a portion of her winnings back to charities in the community. Other plans include buying a house and setting up investments to fund her retirement and her grandchildren's education.

Asked whether she will continue playing, Zilka says, "I'll play occasionally, but this is a dream come true. I don't really need any more." "Ms. Zilka's experience serves as a lesson for our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "It only takes one ticket to win, but you could miss out completely if you don't check that ticket very carefully." Zilka also praised the E Z Shop, located at 3730 North 19th St. in Waco, saying staff members there help the entire community. The store is eligible for a retailer bonus of $304,902.75 for selling the winning ticket. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
