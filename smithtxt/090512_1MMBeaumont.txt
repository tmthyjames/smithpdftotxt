MATCHES FIVE NUMBERS FOR $1 MILLION PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ A Mega Millions® ticket sold in Beaumont matched all five numbers (16 ­ 32 ­ 29 ­ 41 ­ 53) but not the Bonus Ball (16) in last night's drawing. The Megaplier® option was selected for an additional $1, making the ticket worth $1 million. "We are encouraging players in Beaumont and the surrounding areas to check their tickets today," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Someone has a winning ticket worth $1 million, and we are looking forward to finding out who that is." The ticket was purchased at the Dos Amigos located at 1180 Ave. C in Beaumont. Because no tickets matched all five numbers and the Bonus Ball for last night's drawing, the estimated grand/jackpot prize for Friday is $105 million. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery® has generated more than $20 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $38 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed more than $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball®, Mega Millions, Lotto Texas®, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
