DOUBLE THE FUN! PICK 3TM AND DAILY 4TM DRAWINGS NOW FOUR TIMES A DAY!
(AUSTIN) ­ Beginning Sept. 9, the Texas Lottery® will double the number of daily drawings for its popular Pick 3TM and Daily 4TM games. Drawings for both games will now occur on the same schedule as the Texas Lottery's All or NothingTM game. Drawings for Pick 3, Daily 4 and All or Nothing will occur four times a day every Monday through Saturday at 10:00 a.m., 12:27 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 10:12 p.m. (CT). "When we launched the All or Nothing game in September 2012, we found that the new morning and evening draw times were popular with players, particularly the 6:00 p.m. drawing, which proved to be a significant contributor to that game's success," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "Pick 3 and Daily 4 are strong components of Texas' daily games portfolio so this was a natural transition for us."

Players will be able to purchase tickets for the new drawing times starting on Sunday, Sept. 8.

Pick 3 is played by selecting three single-digit numbers from zero to nine and then selecting the order to play the numbers-Exact Order, Any Order, Exact/Any Order, or Combo.

To play Daily 4, players choose four single-digit numbers from zero to nine and then select how to play the numbers-Straight (Exact Order), Box (Any Order), Straight/Box (Exact/Any

Order), or Combo. Daily 4 is also the only game that offers players the opportunity to play pairs -- the Front Pair, Mid Pair or Back Pair.

Both Daily 4 and Pick 3 offer a 50 cent minimum wager and prizes vary depending on the play type selected and the amount wagered. For as little as 50 cents extra per play, both games offer the Sum It Up® feature, which provides another way to win if the sum of the player's numbers is the same as the sum of the numbers drawn.
