DEL VALLE WINNER CLAIMS $2 MILLION SECONDTIER POWERBALL® PRIZE THANKS TO POWER PLAY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Elena Rebollar of Del Valle matched all five numbers (2-7-25-40-56) but not the Powerball® (20) for the drawing held Aug. 31 to win $2 million. Because Rebollar purchased the Power Play® option for $1 more, the $1 million second-tier prize doubled. "I don't really play all the time; it's sort of random. My brother actually gave me the money," said Rebollar. "I just got a Quick Pick at the store." In fact, Rebollar had no idea that her numbers had come up until she went back to her local Texas Lottery® retailer. "I scanned it, and I thought maybe there was an error," explained Rebollar. Rebollar brought her family with her to claim the prize. Not only did her family have a role in the ticket purchase, they also figure prominently into her plans for the money. "I want to use some of the money for college for my two boys," said Rebollar. Bader Food Mart located at 17305 Pearce Lane #A in Del Valle sold the winning ticket.
