40 CITY OF BEAUMONT EMPLOYEES SHARE $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® WIN FROM TUESDAY
(AUSTIN) ­ A group of 40 coworkers in Beaumont have a million reasons to smile today. The group's ticket matched all five numbers (16 ­ 32 ­ 39 ­ 41 ­ 53) but not the Mega Ball (16) for the Mega Millions® drawing held Tuesday night. Normally this would make the ticket-holder eligible for a $250,000 prize, but their decision to Megaply® their winnings bumped the total to a cool $1 million. "It's amazing. We've only been playing since March," said Lois J. Balka, who claimed the prize on behalf of the group. She plans to use a portion of her prize money to help pay college expenses for her grandson. "It is always gratifying to see our winners supporting the education of their loved ones because supporting education is our mission," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Texas Lottery has contributed more than $14 billion in revenue to the Foundation School Fund since 1997, and that makes public education in Texas the biggest winner of all." Balka says the group will continue to play ­ and continue to win. "We are going to win the big prize tonight, and you'll see 19 limos pulling in to Austin on Monday." Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $105 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $100 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million. The Dos Amigos located at 1180 Ave. C in Beaumont sold the winning ticket. (more)
