LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN! ALL OR NOTHINGTM FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY® SET TO LAUNCH THIS WEEKEND
Sales begin Sunday, first draw on Monday morning
(AUSTIN) ­ To match or not to match? That is the question and starting next week, All or NothingTM may be the answer for Texas Lottery® players looking for a revolutionary new way to win big. The first new draw game from the Texas Lottery since Daily 4TM debuted in 2007, All or Nothing features the best overall odds (1 in 4.5) of any Texas draw game and 10 ways to win a prize. Ticket sales for All or Nothing begin Sunday, Sept. 9 and the first drawing will take place on Monday, Sept. 10 at 10 a.m. CT. "All or Nothing is unlike any other draw game offered by the Texas Lottery," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "With a guaranteed top prize of $250,000, players are sure to enjoy this innovative new game and we look forward to the revenue it will generate for public education in Texas." All or Nothing players can win the top prize by matching all 12 of the numbers drawn. However, what sets this new game apart is that players can also win the top prize by matching none of the numbers drawn. That's right, players win the top prize by matching all or none of the numbers drawn. To play All or Nothing, players select 12 numbers from one to 24 or opt for a Quick Pick. In addition to the $250,000 top prize, All or Nothing also offers lower-tier prizes at the $2, $10, $50, and $500 level, depending on how many numbers the player does or does not (more)
