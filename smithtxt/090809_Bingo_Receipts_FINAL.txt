FIRST HALF 2009 CHARITABLE BINGO GROSS RECEIPTS TOP SAME PERIOD IN 2008
(AUSTIN) ­ Charitable Bingo games continued to create more revenue for the sponsoring non-profit organizations during the first and second quarters of 2009, with gross receipts exceeding $360.3 million, a 3.7 percent jump over the first half of 2008. The increase in gross receipts also helped the non-profits distribute $18.6 million for their charitable purposes, a 10.9 percent increase over the same two quarters in 2008. "The increase in gross receipts is especially useful to our licensees right now, when so many non-profits are being called on to do more with their limited resources," said Texas Lottery Commission Director of Charitable Bingo, Philip Sanderson. "The reported charitable distributions for the first two quarters of 2009 are the highest since the first two quarters of 2000." So far in 2009, players have won more than $266.6 million in prizes, a jump of more than 3 percent over the same time period in 2008.

"Overall attendance for the first half of this year was down from the same period in 2008," Sanderson said. "Part of it can be explained by the fact that there were 1,026 fewer bingo occasions held than at this time last year. The average attendance per bingo occasion and the average amount spent per player did increase slightly over last year. Despite the decline in attendance, charitable bingo is still fun for players of all ages, especially long-time players who enjoy playing not only because the game is entertaining, but also because it gives them a chance to socialize with other long-faithful aficionados who feel the same way." There are 1,135 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games. For more information about charitable bingo, please visit the official Texas charitable bingo Web site at http://www.txbingo.org
