WEST TEXAS SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER HAPPY TO BE HIT WITH $1 MILLION BLAST OF CASH
(AUSTIN) ­ It was a happy Monday for Tiffany Graves of Post as she claimed the first of 40 $1 million secondtier prizes available in the $500,000,000 Extreme Cash Blast scratch-off game at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Lubbock. "I was so excited that I nearly fainted in the store," said Graves. "I've only been playing scratch-offs for about a year and my husband says maybe I should quit while I'm ahead, but I'm not so sure!" Graves said the first thing she plans to do with her winnings is buy a new home in the country. The winning ticket was purchased at the Nothin Butt Smokes #10 store located at 300 N. Broadway in Post. The retailer is eligible to receive a $10,000 bonus for selling a scratch-off ticket worth $1 million or more. In addition to the remaining $1 million second-tier prizes, $500,000,000 Extreme Cash Blast offers 10 top prizes of $2.5 million and more than a million prizes from $100 to $500. The odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, in $500,000,000 Extreme Cash Blast are 1 in 2.84. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $120 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $110 million and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $16 million.
