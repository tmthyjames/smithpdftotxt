DEER PARK PLAYER CLAIMS $1 MILLION RUN THE TABLE TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ On Monday, Virginia Kaye Horton of Deer Park claimed the first of three top cash prizes for the Texas Lottery® Run The Table scratch-off game. The $25 ticket offers players the chance to win up to $1 million paid out in a one-time lump-sum payment. "Less than a month after its debut, Run The Table is already a player favorite and it was a pleasure to meet our first top-prize claimant for the game," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "I want to remind our players there are still two $1 million prizes unclaimed in Run The Table, but as always, remember to play responsibly!" In addition to the top prizes of $1 million, Run The Table offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $25 to $20,000. Horton's ticket was purchased at Deer Park Coastal located at 4901 West Pasadena Blvd. in Deer Park. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the prize-winning ticket.
