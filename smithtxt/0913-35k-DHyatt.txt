BONUS CASHWORD FAN STOPS TO BUY COFFEE,
WALKS OUT WITH TICKET WORTH $35,000
(Austin) ­ Dale Hyatt of College Station enjoys playing the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game Bonus Cashword. He says he won $100 just a few weeks ago and plans to keep playing the game after his $35,000 winning experience. "I was on my way to work when I stopped for coffee. I picked up a couple of the Bonus Cashword tickets, stuck them in my pocket and forgot about them. That evening I went to pull out my wallet and found the tickets," said Hyatt. That evening Hyatt scratched both tickets and returned to the store to find out how much he had won. When the clerk told him the prize couldn't be paid at the store, he finally counted up the words and realized he had a ticket worth $35,000 on his hands. "Mr. Hyatt claimed the 14th top prize in the Bonus Cashword game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With a total of more than $61 million in prizes, it's easy to see why players like Mr. Hyatt enjoy this game." Hyatt says this win will have a positive impact on one area of his life in particular. "I'm paying off my mortgage. That's like getting a raise every month." He also has a message for other Texas Lottery players, "It could happen to you."
