PEARLAND MAN WINS $1.2 MILLION PLAYING TEXAS TWO STEP®FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­The last Monday of August proved to be a boon for André Jones Sr of Pearland, who today claimed the $1.2 million Texas Two Step® prize awarded for the drawing on August 31. Mr. Jones purchased one ticket at the Sun Food Mart, 3802 Greeley Street, in Houston. The $1.2 million prize makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. Mr. Jones's Quick Pick ticket carried the four numbers and the bonus ball selected in the drawing, 8--17--24--34, and 7. "In Fiscal Year 2009 which ended August 31, Texas Two Step had the highest sales it has had since FY 2003," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "A big jackpot prize, like the one Mr. Jones won, always drives sales, and it was one of the contributing factors to the good sales showing made by Texas Two Step this past year." Mr. Jones requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $38 million, and tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $53 million.

Note to Editors: Mr. Jones does not use a period after the `Sr' following his last name.
