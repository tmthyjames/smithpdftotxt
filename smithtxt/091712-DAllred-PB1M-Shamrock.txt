SHAMROCK POWERBALL® PLAYER PROVES HIS LUCK
(AUSTIN) ­ David Allred of Mooreville, Mississippi, had trouble convincing his family that he won $1 million in Saturday's Powerball® drawing, but now he has the proof. "I told my wife, a couple of the guys at work, and my brother and sister-in-law," Allred explained. "My wife didn't believe me. I had to send her a picture of the ticket and the winning numbers. I don't think my brother believes it yet." Today, the Texas Lottery® claim center in Amarillo confirmed that his Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (3 ­ 20 ­ 26 ­ 43 ­ 48), but not the Powerball (1), for the drawing held Sept. 15, making it worth a cool $1 million, before taxes. "I almost won the big one. I was only off by three digits on the Powerball. I'm happy with what I got, though," he said. Allred purchased his ticket at the Garrison Food Mart located at 1627 N. Main in Shamrock and says he'll continue to play Powerball each week. Because no tickets won the jackpot prize on Saturday, Wednesday's Powerball drawing will be worth an estimated $149 million. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $15 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $18 million.
