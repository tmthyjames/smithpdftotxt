WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS...REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO $35,000 GOLDEN TICKET WINNER FROM TYLER
(AUSTIN) ­ Just before a recent vacation in Las Vegas, Sharon Cromer of Tyler purchased a $3 Texas Lottery® Golden Ticket scratch-off ticket. Cromer then promptly forgot about the ticket and left it in her car when she departed for Vegas. Comer enjoyed her trip, but it's safe to say she wasn't expecting to come back home a big winner. That changed with a phone call from her son back home. He'd found her ticket and scratched it off. He told her he wasn't completely sure, but he thought it was good for the game's top prize: $35,000! "I really didn't believe him; I thought there was no way we could be that lucky," said Cromer. "I just figured he was reading it wrong or playing a joke." After her flight home, Cromer took her ticket to the Texas Lottery Claim Center in Tyler on Friday and they assured her it was no joke. Shortly after claiming her prize, Cromer was still in a little shock and not sure what she would do with the money, though she was sure of one thing she would not do. "I'm definitely not going back to Vegas, I have much better luck here in Texas," Cromer said. "Maybe I'll go to Disneyland instead!" "Well, Golden Ticket was certainly the right ticket for Ms. Cromer," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "We congratulate her on her win and we hope her good luck continues on her next vacation." Cromer bought her winning ticket at the Quix located at 334 South Beckham Ave. in Tyler.
