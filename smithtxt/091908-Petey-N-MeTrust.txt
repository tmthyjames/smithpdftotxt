SEGUIN-BASED TRUST AT LAST CLAIMS $3.5 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT FROM APRIL 12 DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­Petey and Me Trust of Seguin, Kimberley J. Smith, trustee, has claimed a Lotto Texas® jackpot of $3.5 million that was one of two for the drawing on April 12, and in doing so became a winner of another kind. "Petey and Me Trust of Seguin has now become the winner that has taken the longest to claim a major jackpot prize to date, coming in at 159 days after the drawing and 21 days shy of the 180-day deadline to claim," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "This winner beat out our previous record-holder, a legal entity called the Robert Wantland Family Investments, Ltd., of San Antonio, that waited 147 days to claim back in 1997." The numbers drawn in the April 12 drawing were 2 ­ 3 ­ 8 ­ 12 ­ 25 ­ 27, and this was the second of the two $3.5 jackpots to be claimed. The Kathleen Blankemeyer Trust of Cleveland claimed the other one in August. Frankie's Food Mart, 912 W. Kingsbury, in Seguin, sold the ticket. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the jackpot prize, $35,000, for having sold the ticket. A member of Petey and Me Trust requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
