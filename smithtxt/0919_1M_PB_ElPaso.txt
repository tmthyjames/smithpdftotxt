TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM EL PASO CLAIMS $1 MILLION POWERBALL® PRIZE

(AUSTIN) ­ El Paso resident Santos Rivera claimed one of two $1 million second-tier prizes awarded in the Powerball® drawing held Sept. 3. Rivera's Quick Pick ticket came from The Station located at 1515 Lee Trevino Drive, Suite T in El Paso. The ticket matched all five white balls drawn (2-16-43-45-51) but not the red Powerball (35).

The claimant requested minimal publicity.

A second $1 million winning Quick Pick ticket was purchased for the same drawing at the Midway Food Mart, 621 N. Hewitt Drive in Hewitt. The prize has not yet been claimed.

Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play. The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510.
