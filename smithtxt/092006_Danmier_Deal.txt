A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA FOR RETIREMENT: $50,000 TEXAS LOTTERY® PRIZE WON BY RUNGE RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Maira Danmier of Runge stopped at Jimbo's Drive Inn in Kenedy for gasoline, and saw the new Texas Lottery® Deal or No Deal scratch game. She decided to buy one ticket and now gets to add $50,000 to her retirement plans. "I just love the show (NBC network's Deal or No Deal game show), so I thought I'd try it," said Danmier. "I went over to this little table and scratched away. I was just thinking it wasn't possible; it just couldn't be a winner." She went back to the counter and asked the clerk to run the ticket for her. He came back and told her he couldn't pay the prize amount. "He told me that I had won more than he could pay - $50,000," she explained. "I was just at the right place at the right time. Now, I've got a little bit more to sock away for retirement." Danmier has worked at the Kenedy HEB grocery store for 31 years. She told lottery officials she had plans to retire from the grocery chain in December. "I'm also going to help out my kids a little," she added. "The Deal or No Deal ticket has proven to be very popular with our players," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "For its debut week in the state, sales for the ticket were more than $2.5 million, and it topped the list of favorite scratch games for the week ending September 16."
