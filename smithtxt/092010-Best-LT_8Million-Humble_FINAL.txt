RESIDENT OF HUMBLE WINS $8 MILLION IN LAST WEDNESDAY'S LOTTO TEXAS® DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Lori J. Best of Humble today claimed the $8 million jackpot from last Wednesday's Lotto Texas® drawing.

Because Best chose the cash value option on her Quick Pick ticket, her prize before taxes is $5,510,553.60. The numbers drawn were 3-6-24-36-38-49.

Best purchased the ticket at Ann's All Season Food Store, 607 Wilson Road in Humble. The retailer is now eligible to receive a bonus of $80,000, which is equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, according to Texas Lottery® procedures.

"I'm very grateful to have received this financial blessing," Best said. "My only plans are to help my children with their college educations and to buy a home. I might take a vacation next summer to Hawaii, too."

"Helping out students as they make their way through college is a fitting use for a Lotto Texas jackpot or any Texas Lottery prize because lottery proceeds are transferred to the Foundation School Fund to benefit public education in our state and get students ready for college," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Ms. Best's jackpot win makes this the 526th Lotto Texas ticket that has matched the numbers drawn since drawings began in 1992."

The winner requested minimal publicity.
