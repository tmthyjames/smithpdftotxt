Record-setting year results in more than $1 billion to Foundation School Fund

(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission today reported record results for fiscal year 2012, gaining $133 million in revenue over last year for the state's Foundation School Fund, an increase of 13.8 percent. Record sales of $4.19 billion shattered the previous sales record of $3.81 billion set in 2011 and resulted in a total contribution of $1.096 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. "With sales up 10 percent over last year, this is the ninth consecutive year that the Texas Lottery generated more than $1 billion in contributions to the state of Texas," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "This is our largest transfer to the Foundation School Fund since 1998, and I want to thank all of our players, retailers, vendors and staff for this outstanding performance." The Texas Lottery saw sales increases across its game portfolio. Scratch-off ticket sales totaled more than $3.09 billion and accounted for 73.6 percent of fiscal year 2012 sales. Sales for the Texas Lottery's draw games, which include Powerball®, Mega Millions®, Lotto Texas®, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4® and Cash Five®, totaled more than $1.10 billion and accounted for 26.4 percent of sales.* Sales of the Veterans Cash scratch-off game resulted in $4.7 million for the Fund for Veterans' Assistance, which is administered by the Texas Veterans Commission. Other Texas Lottery funds, including unclaimed prizes, resulted in a transfer of $46 million to the state's General Revenue Fund. In all, approximately 96 percent of the record $4.19 billion in sales was returned to the state in prizes, retailer commissions and bonuses, and transfers to various state funds. (more)
