FIRST $250,000 ALL OR NOTHINGTM TOP PRIZE CLAIMED
Winning ticket matches none of the numbers drawn
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery® announced today that the first top prize winning ticket for the new All or NothingTM game has been claimed. On Monday, Sept. 17, Chun Ye Keifer of Natalia purchased a ticket that did not match any of the numbers drawn in the day drawing, making her the game's first top-prize winner. Though she may have selected all the "wrong" numbers, Keifer got the right result. That's because All or Nothing is the first Texas Lottery drawing game to pay a top prize when you match all or none of the numbers drawn. Keifer, who requested minimal publicity, says she will use her prize to pay college expenses for her children. She purchased her ticket at the H-E-B Food Store #651 located at 19337 McDonald St., Building #1, in Lytle. "We are thrilled to announce our first winner for this revolutionary new game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "All or Nothing is unlike any other lottery game. Not only does it offer the best overall odds of any Texas Lottery drawing game, but you can win big without matching any of the numbers." Texas is the only state to offer the All or Nothing game. Overall odds of winning any All or Nothing prize are one in 4.5. Drawings are held four times a day at 10:00 a.m., 12:27 p.m., 6:00 p.m. and 10:12 p.m., and results can be found on the Texas Lottery website at txlottery.org or on the official Texas Lottery Twitter site at twitter.com/TexasLottery.
