TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER FOLLOWS WINNING STREAK TO $2.5 MILLION PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Thomas H. Wood of Richardson enjoys Texas Lottery® scratch-offs. Every once in a while, he finds himself winning over and over. He says this winning streak brought him almost $3,000, even before he scratched the $500 Million Frenzy ticket that revealed a $2.5 million top prize. "I won $1,000 on Super Set For Life," he explained. "On Saturday, I hit $500. Then I hit $1,000 on Sunday. On Monday, I got two $200 tickets." Later on his way to a home improvement store, Wood found himself near a Speedee Way store that he doesn't get to visit very often. He decided to go inside and spend $20 on a couple of Solid Gold scratch-off tickets. "I went back to my car, scratched the tickets and won my $20 back, so I went back in and bought a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket. I got the $20 back again. Then I bought two of the Texas Lottery® Black tickets and won my $20 again. Then I bought this one." Wood says he never made it to the home improvement store. "Mr. Wood has certainly had an impressive run on winning tickets lately," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Now, he'll be able to make any repairs or updates he needs. $2.5 million will buy a lot of home improvement."

(Texas Lottery Commission, News Release, continued) This is the second of 10 $2.5 million top prizes to be claimed in the $500 Million Frenzy game. The game still has 31 second-tier prizes of $1 million and more than 200 prizes of $25,000 each remaining unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any $500 Million Frenzy prize are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. Games like the Texas Lottery® Black-Series III-Limited Edition and Super Set For Life II are Wood's favorites. He says, "I like the $10 and $20 games. They give you more chances to win." He won't be the only one benefitting from this good fortune, either. For selling the winning ticket, the Speedee Way at 1931 N. Jupiter Road in Garland is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $86 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $30 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $8 million.
