WOODWAY RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION PRIZE IN THE $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ R Craig Colwick of Woodway claimed a $1 million prize in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game today. There are still 29 prizes of $1 million and eight prizes of $2.5 million each remaining. Odds of winning any prize are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. "The $500,000,000 Blockbuster played an important role in Texas Lottery sales during Fiscal Year 2009," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Thanks in part to this popular scratch-off ticket, we surpassed last year's sales and contributed over $1 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports Texas education." For selling the winning ticket, Woodway's HEB Food Store #583 located at 9100 Woodway Drive is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $62 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $57 million.
