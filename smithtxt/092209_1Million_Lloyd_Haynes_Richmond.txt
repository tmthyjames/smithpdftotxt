RICHMOND MAN WINS $1 MILLION IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Lloyd Haynes of Richmond had to be talked into buying a couple of $500,000,000 Blockbuster tickets by his wife, and it turned out to be a great thing. "We were on our way home last Friday night from the Terry and Baytown Lee football game when my wife, Lovie, told me to stop and buy some $500,000,000 Blockbuster tickets," Haynes said. "I was reluctant because I had not done well with this ticket, and I've been buying it since it came out earlier this summer. But I bought two of them anyway." At home by 9:30, Haynes scratched the first of his two tickets. While going through the first one, his initial reluctance had turned into a scold. "I asked myself several times, `Why did I buy this?'" he said. "Then, I started on the second one, going through the winning numbers first, then the rest of the ticket. I saw a winning number again and it was next to a symbol for the $1 million. Once I saw that I started yelling for Lovie." A cool customer, Mrs. Haynes saw the ticket and said, "Well, we won a million dollars." Mr. Haynes called his son, Lloyd, Jr., so he could come over and see the ticket. "The rest of the night I stayed up watching the ticket to make sure the numbers didn't change," he said.

The new winner said he doesn't have special plans for his new prize. "One thing I do want to do is help my children who gave us our nine grandkids," Haynes said. "This money will go to help them with their kids' educations. Lovie and I might take a little trip, too." "It's especially fitting that Mr. Haynes is using his prize to help his grandchildren to go to college," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "The mission of the Texas Lottery is to generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund, so it's great to learn that this prize money is being utilized to support the educational goals of Mr. Haynes' grandchildren." Haynes purchased the ticket at Rudy's Stop N Shop, 1018 Damon Street, in Rosenberg. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus. This is the tenth prize of $1 million to be claimed in this game. The game offers 40 of this amount. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $62 million, and tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $57 million.
