DALLAS RESIDENT WINS REALLY COOL $1 MILLION IN FRIDAY NIGHT'S MEGA MILLIONS®
(AUSTIN) ­ Robert W. Willingham gets a $22 stipend from his wife every Tuesday and Thursday to buy Mega Millions® tickets and a coke. Last week was no different, except that this time, the Quick Pick Mega Millions ticket he bought had five of the six numbers selected in Friday's drawing, winning him a cool $1 million. As a result of where Willingham decided to hide the ticket, the prize got even cooler, downright frosty, in fact. "The banks were closed over the weekend and we couldn't get to the safe deposit box," Willingham said. "So we put the ticket in a baggie and stashed it in the icebox." On Sunday, Willingham had to go out to tend to some errands, so his wife, Vickie, got icebox duty. "I got to stay home to guard the freezer," she said. "It was ok, though." Willingham says he's going to buy his wife something she wants with his winnings. "Vickie is getting a new car," he said. "We're going to save the rest for a house project in the future." This isn't the first time Willingham has won a prize. "This summer I parlayed $10 into $75 playing a scratch game called John Wayne, The Duke," he said. "I've also won other amounts in the past, but nothing like this." Willingham bought the ticket at Red Beer & Wine, 4218 W. Lovers Lane, Dallas. The store is eligible to earn a $10,000 bonus for selling the ticket.
