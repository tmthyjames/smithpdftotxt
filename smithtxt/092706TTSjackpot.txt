NEAR-HIGH RECORD FOR TEXAS TWO STEP®; ODDS ARE GOOD TO WIN MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) - It's been five months since the Texas Two Step® jackpot hit its all-time high at $2.9 million. For Thursday night's drawing, the game has reached its third highest level, $1.95 million, meaning players have great odds of cashing in on some big money. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million and overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 32. "It's anyone's jackpot to win, provided players purchase a ticket. One big reason to play; if one ticket matches all the numbers for Thursday's drawing, the prize would be paid in a single payment," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Texas Two Step has many options that players may find appealing. Besides the great overall odds and odds of winning a jackpot, the remaining prize tiers offer large cash prizes." Texas Two Step experienced an increase in sales for the lottery's 2006 fiscal year. Total sales were more than $47 million, up 5.1 percent from 2005. "Sales (Texas Two Step) so far for the new fiscal year, which started September 1, are really keeping in line with the fact that the jackpot is at a near high," said Sadberry. Players choose four numbers from a field of 35 and a Bonus Ball from a second field of 35 numbers. Drawings are held every Monday and Thursday evening at 10:12 p.m. ...
