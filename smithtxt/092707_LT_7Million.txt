CLOCK WINDING DOWN FOR $7 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® TICKET (AUSTIN) ­ With less than a month remaining before time runs out, the
Texas Lottery Commission hopes to find out who has the $7 million jackpotwinning ticket from the Lotto Texas® drawing held April 21. The winning numbers for that drawing were 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 47. The 180-day period to claim this Lotto Texas prize will expire on October 18 if no claimant with the matching ticket contacts the agency. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry said, "We encourage everyone to double-check their numbers for that drawing because someone could lose out on $7 million." If no claimant comes forward, the cash value prize money will be transferred to the Unclaimed Prize Fund. The first $10 million in unclaimed prizes each fiscal year is allocated to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) through the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. After that, unclaimed prize money goes to the General Revenue Fund. Unaudited figures show the Unclaimed Prize Fund received $58,895,469 for Fiscal Year 2007 which ended August 31. The missing Lotto Texas ticket was purchased at the Calvert Deli & Grocery, 1136 S. Virginia St., in Terrell.
