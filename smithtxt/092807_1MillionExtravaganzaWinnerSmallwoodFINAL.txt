O'DONNELL MAN WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $1 MILLION EXTRAVAGANZA FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Eddie L. Smallwood, a vocational agriculture teacher at O'Donnell High School, is the winner of the second top prize of $1 million in the Texas Lottery® scratch game, $1 Million Extravaganza. He and his wife, Vicky, a math teacher at the same high school, were at Lottery headquarters in Austin Wednesday to collect the second of the four top prizes of $1 million offered in this game. "It is the Lottery's mission to support public education and the Foundation School Fund with the proceeds garnered from the sale of Lottery tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Texas teachers are some of our hardest-working citizens, and it's great to see one of them win such a significant prize." "We kept the ticket in the safe deposit box in the bank all this time," Smallwood said. "I bought the ticket on Sunday, August 5 and put it in the bank first thing Monday morning." He bought the ticket at Allsup's #306, O'Donnell Loop and Hwy. 287, O'Donnell. The store is eligible to receive a $10,000 bonus for selling the ticket. Smallwood requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth $7 million.
