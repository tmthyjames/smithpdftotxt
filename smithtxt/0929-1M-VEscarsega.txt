$250,000 SECOND-TIER MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE BECOMES $1 MILLION THANKS TO MEGAPLIER®
(Austin) ­ There is a new Texas Lottery® winner in El Paso today. Victor Escarsega claimed a Mega Millions® prize worth $1 million. Escarsega matched all five numbers (2 ­ 20 ­ 28 ­ 36 ­ 45) but not the Mega Ball (37) drawn on September 27. Normally, this would give him a $250,000 second-tier prize. Because Escarsega chose to Megaply® his ticket for an extra $1, his prize increased to a guaranteed $1 million. The winning ticket was purchased at the Murphy USA #6909 located at 10655 Gateway Blvd. W. in El Paso. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $113 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $47 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
