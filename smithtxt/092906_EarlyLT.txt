(AUSTIN) ­ Since January 2006, the Texas Lottery® has paid five Lotto Texas® jackpot winners, including today's payout to Fidelma Early of Southlake. Early's Lotto Texas ticket correctly matched all six numbers for the September 23 drawing, worth an advertised $10 million. Since April, when Lotto Texas players returned to choosing a straight set of six numbers, there have been four jackpot winners. "It has been a successful year for our players and the Texas Lottery," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "Not only have our players cashed in on a substantial prize amount, more than $2.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2006, but overall the Texas Lottery saw an increase in sales and that translated into transfers to the Foundation School Fund in excess of $1.029 billion." Early chose the Cash Value Option when purchasing her ticket and received $6,073,964, before taxes. The Quick Pick ticket was bought at 7-Eleven #32922, located at 1660 W.
