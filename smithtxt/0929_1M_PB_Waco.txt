TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM WACO CLAIMS POWERBALL® PRIZE WORTH $1,000,004

(AUSTIN) ­ John Rougely of Waco claimed a second-tier Powerball® prize worth $1,000,004. Rougely purchased his Quick Pick ticket at the Midway Food Mart located at 621 N. Hewitt Drive in Hewitt. The ticket matched all five white balls (2-16-43-45-51) but not the red Powerball (35) drawn on Sept. 3.

The claimant requested minimal publicity.

Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play. The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510.
