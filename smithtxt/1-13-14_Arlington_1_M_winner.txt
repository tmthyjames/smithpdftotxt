(AUSTIN) ­ Keith Pool of Arlington claimed a second-tier Powerball® prize worth $1 million at the Texas Lottery claim center in Fort Worth on Friday. He claimed just in time too, as the ticket was scheduled to expire on Feb. 3.

Pool purchased a ticket for the drawing held Wednesday, Aug. 7, at the Valero Corner Store #1738, 4900 W. Sublette Rd in Arlington. The ticket matched all five numbers drawn (5-25-30-58-59) but not the Powerball (32).

This claimant requested minimal publicity.
