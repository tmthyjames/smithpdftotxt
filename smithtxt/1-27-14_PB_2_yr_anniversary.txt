POWERBALL® GAME CREATES MORE THAN 500 MILLIONAIRES EACH YEAR IN THE U.S.
Current game design celebrates two-year anniversary

(AUSTIN) ­ This month marks the two-year anniversary of the current $2 Powerball® game design, and the improved features have paid off big for players in Texas and across the country. When the current game was introduced Jan.15, 2012, the Multi-State Lottery Association forecast at least 300 millionaires would be created each year, and Powerball has delivered. Nationally, in the last 24 months, the Powerball game created 1,013 millionaires, an average of more than 500 millionaires each year, or nine millionaires per week.

The $2 Powerball game was designed to offer larger starting jackpots that grow quickly, more chances to become a millionaire and better overall odds. In the past two years, Powerball has created the four largest jackpots in the game's 20-plus-year history. The increased Match 5 prize of $1 million, or $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play®, gives players more chances to become a millionaire. Nationally, in the past two years, 979 Match 5 tickets won a total of more than $1 billion in cash prizes; of these, 847 players received $1 million prizes and 133 players received $2 million prizes. Also, as a result of reducing overall odds, more than 160 million players in the U.S. have won a Powerball prize in the last two years, including 34 multi-million dollar jackpot prize winners. "We are thrilled that Powerball continues to exceed player expectations, allowing it to be a huge success for players and for public education in Texas," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery.

With national sales of $11 billion, the new Powerball game has resulted in millions of dollars in retailer commissions and revenue to support worthwhile causes in every Powerball state. In Texas, $239.1 million has been generated to support public education since the Powerball changes took effect in 2012 and retailers have received $28.4 million in commissions. "Texas players have benefited from the new Powerball game, as more than 11,360,191 winning tickets have been sold in the state," said Grief. "Our players enjoy the chance to play for big prizes and the

Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Players win by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win nonjackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play.
