BROWNSVILLE RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Denise N. Garza, of Brownsville, today claimed a Mega Millions® prize worth $1,000,005. The ticket for the Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2013 drawing was purchased at Stripes located at 3595 W. Alton Gloor in Brownsville.

Garza matched five of the numbers drawn, (8-14-17-20-39) but not the Mega Ball number (7) to win $1 million. Garza also matched at a lower prize level for an additional $5 on the same ticket. Jackpot winning tickets for the drawing's $648 million jackpot prize were sold in California and Georgia.

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but can still walk away winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
