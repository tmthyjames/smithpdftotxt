MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUBTM LOTTERY GAME TO MAKE MORE AND MORE MILLIONAIRES !
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas is ready to mint some new millionaires! The Texas Lottery® joins participating lotteries across the country in offering a new draw game, MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB, that will spread the wealth among players by offering multiple $1 million prizes in conjunction with a Top Prize that is capped at $25 million. With three different ways to win, the MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB game goes on sale in Texas on Oct. 19, and is the first multi-state game to combine traditional lottery with the fun and entertainment of a national television game show featuring players selected from among ticket holders who have registered their tickets online.

Players can win the Top Prize (up to $25 million) in MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES CLUB weekly drawings; become one of the many, randomly-selected $1 million winners when another player wins the Top Prize in a weekly drawing; or register a ticket online where they will build MONOPOLY brand themed property sets to earn entries in a drawing for a chance to appear on the nationally televised game show, which will have more than $2.5 million in available prize money on each episode.

The unique design of the $5 game is expected to generate more millionaires than any other game in lottery history. With drawings on Friday evenings at 10:15 p.m. Central, players across the country will have the opportunity to wake up as millionaires. In early 2015, the "MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB" television series will welcome players from participating states to its studio audience in Las Vegas where they will compete before a live audience to win up to $1 million. Comedian and actor Billy Gardell ("Mike & Molly," "You, Me and Dupree") has been tapped to host the show. Each MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB ticket will have a unique code that players can use to register online for a chance to appear on the television show. Thousands of players will win a fiveday, four-night trip for two to Las Vegas to join the show's studio audience. Contestants on the show more
