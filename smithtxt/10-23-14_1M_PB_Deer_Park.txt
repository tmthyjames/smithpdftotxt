POWERBALL® PLAYER FROM DEER PARK WINS $1 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ Mark A. Landers, of Deer Park, claimed a Powerball® second-tier prize worth $1 million. Landers purchased his ticket at the Tobacco Stop located at 3408 Center St. in Deer Park. His Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (13-18-24-25-33) but not the Powerball (31) for the drawing held Oct. 4.

The claimant requested minimal publicity. Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play®. The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510.
