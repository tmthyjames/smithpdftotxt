FIRST HALF 2010 CHARITABLE BINGO DISTRIBUTIONS TOP SAME PERIOD IN 2009
(Austin) ­ Charitable bingo games continued to create revenue for the sponsoring non-profit organizations during the first and second quarters of 2010, with gross receipts of $356.9 million only slightly down from the first half of 2009. The gross receipts helped the non-profits distribute $18.8 million for their charitable purposes in 2010, a slight increase over the same period in 2009.

"The distributions are especially useful to our licensees right now, when so many non-profits are being called on to do more with their limited resources," said Texas Lottery Commission Director of Charitable Bingo Philip Sanderson. "Additionally, players have won more than $266.5 million in prizes during the first six months of 2010."

(Texas Lottery Commission news release, continued) "Overall attendance during the first half of 2010 was down from the same period in 2009," Sanderson said. "Part of it can be explained by the fact that there were 884 fewer bingo occasions held than at this time last year. While the average attendance per bingo occasion is down slightly, the average amount spent per player did increase over last year. Despite a small decline in attendance, charitable bingo is still fun for players of all ages, especially long-time players who enjoy the game not only because it is entertaining, but because it gives them a chance to socialize with other long-faithful aficionados who feel the same way."

In Texas, 1,108 non-profits conduct charitable bingo games.
