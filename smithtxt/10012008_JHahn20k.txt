YOAKUM TRICKSTER WINS HALLOWEEN TREAT
(AUSTIN) ­ You might call him the man who cried "jackpot". James Hahn of Yoakum often teased his wife as a practical joke that he'd won big money playing the lottery. It's understandable that his family didn't believe it when he finally won a $20,000 top prize in the Monster Money scratch-off from the Texas Lottery®. "I called home and told my wife and daughter that I won $20,000 dollars, but my wife said she wouldn't believe it until she saw the ticket," he said. Of course, Hahn couldn't pass up one more joke. "I showed her the wrong ticket and said I must have thrown the winning ticket away," he explained. He eventually came clean because, as he said, "I know she would have driven back up there to find that ticket."

"Mr. Hahn is our second top prize winner from the Monster Money game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Holiday-themed games, like this one, are popular year after year, and we look forward to meeting future winners. That is always our treat." Eight top prizes remain in the Monster Money game, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.64, including break-even prizes. Hahn purchased his winning ticket from the Highway 21 Truck Stop located at 2714 Highway 21 West in Bryan. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $42 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $13 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
