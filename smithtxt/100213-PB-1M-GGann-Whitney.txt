WHITNEY RESIDENT WINS $1,000,300 POWERBALL® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Gary L Gann of Whitney traveled to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin today to claim a Powerball® ticket with a total value of $1,000,300. He managed to pick all of the numbers drawn on Sept. 25 (2­7­17­49­53), but not the Powerball number (23). Normally this would mean a $1 million prize, but Gann also matched at lower prize levels for an additional $300 on the same ticket. If the ticket had matched the Powerball number it would have been worth an estimated $50 million, before taxes. The Lamp Post store located at 4595 FM 933 in Whitney sold the lucky ticket for last Wednesday's drawing. The claimant requested minimum publicity. About the Texas Lottery Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $21 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $41 billion in prizes to lottery players.
