ODESSA RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $1 MILLION VEGAS LUCK FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Roberto Lozoya of Odessa has redeemed a Texas Lottery® scratch ticket, $1 Million Vegas Luck, and collected the top prize of $1 million. This is the first of the game's four top prizes of $1 million to be claimed. Lozoya bought the ticket at the Allsup's #279, Highway 115 and East Avenue, in Kermit.
