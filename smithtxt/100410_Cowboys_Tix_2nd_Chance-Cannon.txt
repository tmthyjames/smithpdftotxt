DALLAS COWBOYS FAN WINS 2011 SEASON TICKETS IN TEXAS LOTTERY® 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­John Cannon of Dallas will sit between the 30-yard lines at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington next year to watch his favorite team play football. That's thanks to the 2011 season tickets he won in a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing after mailing in his non-winning Dallas Cowboys scratch-off tickets.

"When I heard the message from the woman at the lottery, I thought somebody was pulling a prank on me," Cannon said. "But when she gave me a 512-area code number to call back, I knew it was Austin and thought it might be real. Winning this is fantastic, and the fact is, you can't win a prize unless you send in those tickets. If you don't, you're chances of winning a prize like this are zero."

"Mr. Cannon is right about sending in the tickets, because that is the only way you have a chance to win in the drawings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Dallas Cowboys game also offers players a top prize of $250,000, as well as lower-tier prizes of $5,000 down to the break-even prize of $10. Proceeds from the Texas Lottery are sent to the Foundation School Fund to benefit public education." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $41 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $9 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $60 million.
