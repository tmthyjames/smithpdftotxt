DIE-HARD DALLAS COWBOYS FAN CLAIMS 2010 SEASON TICKETS FROM SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ The first second-chance drawing for the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off ticket was held recently, and Kelly Pilkington of Fort Worth was among the 20 names pulled for pairs of 2010 season tickets. "I am the biggest die-hard Cowboys fan," said Pilkington. She added, "I have watched the Cowboys basically since birth." In fact, Pilkington has already attended a game at the new stadium, but next year she'll have reserved seats between the 30-yard lines and plenty of company. "My friends are already coming out of the woodwork." Undaunted when she didn't win an instant cash prize, Pilkington said she sent ten tickets in for the second-chance drawing.
