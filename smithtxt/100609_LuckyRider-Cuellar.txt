CIVIL SERVANT ON A TEXAS LOTTERY® LUCKY RIDER CHOPPER? LOOK FOR IT IN SAN ANGELO
(AUSTIN) ­Collette Cuellar is a self-described civil servant who now has a chance to rev up her very own chopper to get to the office. Cuellar stopped in at the Snack & Tackle, 5102 Knickerbocker Road in San Angelo, to pick up a few Lucky Rider tickets. "I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the little chopper symbol, I kept thinking I was looking at it wrong," Cuellar said. "I told the store manager, `You just sold me a chopper ticket.' He got as excited as I did. "I love buying scratch-offs," she said. "They've been lucky for me. I won $2,500 with Set For Life a few years ago and $600 over one weekend not long ago, too. Even my husband tells me to buy them." Her husband got the first phone call about the apparent chopper win. "I woke him up," she said. "He called me back a few hours later to ask me if I'd really called him to tell him I'd won a motorcycle." "The wide-open spaces in Texas make this chopper prize just the thing for some of our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This custom-made red and black motorcycle isn't the only prize in this game, however. There are four prizes of $50,000, as well as thousands more ranging in amounts of $1,000 down to the break-even prize of $5. Additionally, the value of the chopper includes tax, title and license."
