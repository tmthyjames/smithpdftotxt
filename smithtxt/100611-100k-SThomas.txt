FOUR-YEAR TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER WINS $100,000 TOP PRIZE IN $100,000 FORTUNE GAME
(Austin) ­ After four years of playing Texas Lottery® games, Sherretta Thomas of Tenaha may know the secret to winning a top prize. "Don't give up. It will come sooner or later," she said. Her recent win came courtesy of a $100,000 Fortune ticket she purchased at Rudy's #4, 498 N. George Bowers Drive in Tenaha. "With more than $20 million in total prizes, it's no wonder that Texas Lottery players like Ms. Thomas enjoy the $100,000 Fortune scratch-off game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. Two top prizes of $100,000 each and 27 second-tier prizes currently remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.59, including break-even prizes. "When I scratched it, I had to take a double look," said Thomas. "I was overwhelmed with joy. I couldn't stop shaking." Thomas, who plays every Friday, said the money will make life a little easier for her, and she plans to use it to take care of her family. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $14 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $71 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit www.txlottery.org. ###
