IRVING RESIDENT WINS 2011 SEASON TICKETS IN TEXAS LOTTERY® 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­John Madrid of Irving is no stranger to winning in the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off second-chance drawings. Last year, he entered several non-winning tickets and won a team jersey. He hit it again this year, winning tickets to the Dallas Cowboys 2011 season.

The Southwest Airlines mechanic also knows someone else who has won Cowboys season tickets. "One of my co-workers won season tickets last year," he said. "He's using them right now." Madrid said he enjoys playing Texas Lottery® scratch-offs and doesn't mind sending in the tickets for the second-chance drawings. "To tell you the truth, I had forgotten about the Dallas Cowboys tickets I had sent in. I thought the woman from the lottery was calling me about Jumbo Bucks, another game that has a second-chance drawing. It was definitely a surprise."

"Even if players don't win a prize the first time, the Dallas Cowboys game, through its secondchance drawings, offers fans a variety of outstanding opportunities to participate with their favorite team, whether it's through watching a game in Cowboys Stadium or wearing a jersey," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The ticket's top prize is $250,000, and lowertier prizes start at $5,000 down to the break-even prize of $10. The proceeds from this game benefit the Foundation School Fund to support public education in Texas." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million.
