HOUSTON MAN FIRST TO CLAIM HOUSTON TEXANS 2011-12 SEASON TICKETS IN 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­Hector Gil of Houston was en route to work when he got the phone call that thrilled him. A Texas Lottery® official informed him that the non-winning Houston Texans tickets he had entered in a second-chance drawing won him tickets to see the Houston Texans play during their 2011and 2012 seasons.

"This is very exciting," Gil said. "I called my wife right away and the first thing she said was, `You're kidding, right?' We're both very happy about this. I'm already making a list of who will be going with me to the games to sit between the 30-yard lines. Besides my wife, my sons, my godson and a few friends will also enjoy these tickets with me."

"Mr. Gil is our first 2011 Houston Texans season tickets winner to claim in the second-chance drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We're pleased to award this prize to a winner who is generously sharing it with family and friends. The game also has 14 top cash prizes of $75,000, five of which have been claimed. The odds of winning any prize in the Houston Texans game are one in 3.82"

"I'm so grateful to be going to the games next season," Gil said. "The Texans are my team, win or lose. My advice to other players is to keep trying. Look at me, I won." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million.
