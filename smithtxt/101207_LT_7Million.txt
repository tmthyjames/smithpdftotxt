LESS THAN ONE WEEK LEFT TO CLAIM $7 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT FROM APRIL
(AUSTIN) ­ Nearly six months after the April 21 drawing, a jackpotwinning Lotto Texas® ticket worth $7 million remains unclaimed. Officials at the Texas Lottery Commission continue asking the public to double-check any tickets purchased for the drawing because the deadline to claim the money is fast approaching. If no claimant comes forward with the matching ticket by October 18, the agency will transfer the cash value of the jackpot, more than $4 million, to the Unclaimed Prize Fund. "Once again, we urge everyone to check their numbers against those drawn or bring their ticket to the nearest claim center for verification," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "If you are unable to reach a claim center, you can mail in the ticket for processing." The winning numbers were 19, 16, 21, 18, 47, and 17. Calvert Deli & Grocery, 1136 S. Virginia St., in Terrell sold the missing Lotto Texas ticket. The ticket was not a Quick Pick, and the player selected the annual payments option at the time of purchase. In most cases, ticket holders must claim prizes for online games such as Lotto Texas within 180 days of the drawing. Texas allocates the first $10 million in unclaimed prizes to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) through the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. Any additional unclaimed prize money goes to the General Revenue Fund. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Texas Lottery Web site at http://www.txlottery.org.
