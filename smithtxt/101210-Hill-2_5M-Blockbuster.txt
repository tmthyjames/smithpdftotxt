FAITHFUL TO $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER, MESQUITE WINNER FINALLY HITS TOP PRIZE
(Austin) ­ TREKDB, LLC, Lonnie E. Hill Jr., Manager, of Mesquite today claimed the top prize of $2.5 million in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. Hill thought 2010 would be his year to win a big prize. It came true, thanks in large part to buying several $500,000,000 Blockbuster tickets every week since the game debuted in May 2009.

"I buy one of these tickets almost every other day," Hill said. "The day I bought this one, the lights had gone out at the wholesale plumbing supply store where I work, so I went across the street to Jack's Grocery to buy my one ticket while I waited for the lights to return. When I saw what I had, I put the ticket in my pocket, got to the bank right before closing time and put it in the safety deposit box."

Hill made a copy of the ticket and put it on the dining room table along with the key to the deposit box, but his wife, Julia, didn't give it a second look after seeing it there. It wasn't until later when Hill put the copy and the key on one of their pillows in the bedroom that she got a good look at it, good enough to keep her up most of the night.

"I can't retire from work just yet, but I can retire some of my debt, which is what I plan to do with my prize," he said. "My family and I will celebrate winning this prize sometime later this month, and we'll be going back to Schlitterbahn next July for our family vacation like we've done for several years now. I plan to keep playing, too. My wife is also going to keep playing the only game she plays, Pick 3, which has been a great game for her."
