LOTTO TEXAS® WINNER MAKES SHORT, HAPPY DRIVE FROM
BRENHAM TO AUSTIN TO CLAIM $25 MILLION JACKPOT
(Austin) ­ Brenham, located about halfway between Austin and Houston, is a small Texas town that just became home to a big Texas Lottery® winner. On Tuesday, Kenneth L. Michalk claimed an advertised $25 million Lotto Texas® jackpot from the drawing held on September 7. Since Michalk chose the Cash Value Option when he purchased his ticket, he received a lump-sum prize of $18,397,860, before taxes. Michalk was understandably emotional when he talked about his win at Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin. "I remember pouring a cup of coffee and getting out my magnifying glass to check the numbers," said Michalk. "I got up and went outside for a few minutes and checked again to make sure I was reading it right. I think I did that a few times." Michalk said one of the best parts of his winning experience is that he purchased his ticket from his good friends at K & M Grocery & Service Station, located at 3600 Highway 36 South in Brenham. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $250,000 for selling the jackpot winner. As for his winnings, Michalk plans to use the bulk to purchase an annuity that will pay out well into his 80s and he commented that, "After that, I don't think I'll be too worried about money anymore." The numbers selected in the September 7 drawing were 5-6-14-25-36-44. Besides Michalk's jackpot prize, 24 players matched five of six numbers, winning each one $1,574. "I want to congratulate Mr. Michalk for his Lotto Texas win," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "I also want to commend him for his plans to use his winnings to secure his financial future." (more)
