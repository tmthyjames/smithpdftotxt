THE HOLIDAYS CAME EARLY FOR A $1 MILLION MERRY MILLIONS WINNER FROM TELFERNER
(AUSTIN) ­ Richard Skinner of Telferner is celebrating the holidays early after winning $1 million in the new Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Merry Millions. This is the first of five top prizes in the game. Launched less than one week ago, Merry Millions has already paid out thousands of prizes. The game features more than $38 million in total prizes and overall odds of one in 3.03. Skinner's winning ticket came from Tipton's Conoco located at 5903 Houston Highway in Victoria, making the store eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. "We've been a lottery dealer for years, but we've never had a win like this," said Don Tipton of Tipton's Conoco. "Anytime you get a big winner, it's pretty exciting, and this person has been a good lottery customer." "The holidays may still be months away, but big wins like this one can certainly make our players' days a little merrier. Of course, with more than $14 billion contributed to the Foundation School Fund since 1997, Texas education remains the biggest winner of all," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $53 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $60 million and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $25 million.
