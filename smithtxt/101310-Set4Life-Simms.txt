WACO RESIDENT WINS TOP PRIZE IN SET FOR LIFE GAME; RECEIVES $250,000 PER YEAR FOR 20 YEARS
(Austin) ­Tommy Ross Simms, Sr., of Waco already knows what he will do with his top prize of $250,000 per year for the next 20 years. He plans to build a new home for himself with the winnings from Set For Life, a Texas Lottery® scratch-off game.

"I want to pay off my debts, too," the retired Army veteran said. "This isn't the first time that I have won money from the Texas Lottery, either. I got $1,800 playing Cash Five years ago."

Simms told Lottery officials that he purchased one Set For Life ticket, won some money and bought a few more. When he scratched a ticket from the second batch he purchased, he saw the word, "LIFE," stopped scratching, put the ticket away and went home. "I wasn't going to tell anybody in the store what I thought I had."

Simms bought the ticket yesterday at the Shayam Food Mart, Inc., 1200 LaSalle Avenue in Waco. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket.

"Since we first issued Set For Life in 2004, it has been a favorite among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The current version of this $10-game was released in July, and Mr. Simms today claimed the first of the game's three top prizes. We wish him all the best building his new home."
