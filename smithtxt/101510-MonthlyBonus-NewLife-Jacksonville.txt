NEW LIFE PARTNERSHIP OF JACKSONVILLE TAKES HOME TOP PRIZE IN MONTHLY BONUS SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­New Life Partnership, Robert Parker, General Partner, of Jacksonville today claimed the top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years in Monthly Bonus, a Texas Lottery® scratch-off. The prize totals $2,400,000.

The Food Fast 107, 319 E. Larissa, Jacksonville, sold the top-prize-winning ticket, which makes this location eligible to receive a retailer bonus of $10,000.

This is the third of four top prizes to be awarded in this ticket. This $5 game was released in January and has now been issued seven times. The game began with 1,029,752 prizes, of which more than 670,000 have been claimed.

"This week alone, Texas Lottery players have won $17.4 million in top prizes of more than $1 million in scratch-off games," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "A $500,000,000 Blockbuster Mesquite winner took home $2.5 million. Ultimate Casino Jackpot gave an Austin man $7.5 million, and a Waco resident received a top prize that will total $5 million after 20 years playing Set for Life. Today's winner claimed a Monthly Bonus top prize that totals $2.4 million after 20 years. We also had second-chance drawing winners who took home season tickets to the home games of the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans." New Life Partnership is not the only Monthly Bonus winner to emerge from Jacksonville. In January of 2007, the Hanson Family Trust, Curtis Wayne Hanson, Trustee, of Gallatin claimed the Monthly Bonus top prize with a ticket purchased in Jacksonville at the Thompson Oil/Fas-Fil #1, located at 1517 E. Rusk.
