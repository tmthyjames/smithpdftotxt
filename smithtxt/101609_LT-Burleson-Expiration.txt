LOTTO TEXAS® TICKET SOLD IN BURLESON WILL EXPIRE EARLY IN NOVEMBER
(AUSTIN) ­A Lotto Texas® Cash Value Option jackpot ticket worth $7.1 million purchased in Burleson for the drawing on May 6 remains unclaimed and expires Monday, November 2. "No person or group has come forward to claim this major prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "The expiration date is just over two weeks out, and we're hoping that this alert will encourage Lotto Texas players in and around Burleson, or even those that may have stopped in Burleson before that drawing, to search back through their old tickets. They might find something very important." The player(s) bought the ticket that matched the numbers drawn (414-21-29-34-43) at the Big Country Mart, 4624 Highway 1187, in Burleson. The advertised jackpot was $11 million, but the Cash Value Option amount totals $7,131,735.60. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $200 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
