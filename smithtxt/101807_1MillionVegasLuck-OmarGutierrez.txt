ODESSA RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING $1 MILLION VEGAS LUCK FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Omar C. Gutierrez of Odessa on Wednesday claimed a $1 million prize after playing the Texas Lottery® scratch game, $1 Million Vegas Luck. Gutierrez bought two $25 tickets on a whim after he stepped out of his normal work-day routine, visiting a convenience store on his morning break, through which he usually works. On top of that, a co-worker to whom he was going to give a gift of $100 quit work that morning, leaving Gutierrez with $100 he had not anticipated having. "I had been winning amounts of $100 pretty regularly on a $30 ticket, but this time, for reasons I can't explain, I decided to buy two $25 tickets," he said. "I called my wife, but she didn't believe me when I told her what the ticket said. It wasn't until we went to the claim center and verified the ticket that she realized I was right. I have a safe at home where I keep important papers, and that's where I decided to put the ticket." "During the last four weeks, we've had at least four winners of major prizes from the same West Texas area," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "In fact, another Odessa resident won $1 million playing the same $1 Million Vegas Luck. An O'Donnell teacher won $1 million playing $1 Million Extravaganza, and, of course, we had a grandmother from Odessa who also won $1 million, but she was playing Texas Two Step."

Gutierrez bought the ticket at the Town & Country #232, 101 West Yukon Road in Odessa. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. The new winner said he already knows what he's going to do with his prize. "I plan to pay off my bills," Gutierrez said. "I'll pay off the mortgage first. I also plan to help my family." Gutierrez requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $34 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth $13 million.
