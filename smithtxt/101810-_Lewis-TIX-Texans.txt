CHANNELVIEW MAN LOOKING FORWARD TO TWO SEASONS WITH HIS TEAM, THE HOUSTON TEXANS
(Austin) ­Emmett Lewis of Channelview won a pair of tickets to the 2011 and 2012 seasons of the Houston Texans and called it "a real blessing." Thanks to entering his non-winning Houston Texans scratch-offs in a second-chance drawing held September 22, he will get to spend many Sundays with his favorite football team.

"It's such a blessing to win," Lewis said. "The best thing is that, win or lose, I know where the money is going, to a great cause, public education in our state. I enjoy buying lottery tickets, and I never feel like I've wasted my money because I know whatever I spend is going to help some school kid down the road."

"It's always great to see our winners recognize that Texas Lottery proceeds benefit public education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Since 1997 when Lottery proceeds were dedicated to the Foundation School Fund, we've sent more than $13 billion back to the state to support our public schools. Mr. Lewis is one of the 10 winners of a pair of 2011 and 2012 Houston Texans season tickets."

Lewis works in the office of Harris County Commissioner Sylvia Garcia. When he got the call from Texas Lottery® officials telling him of his prize, he celebrated so loudly, he did not have to tell the 18 other people who also work there that he had won.

(Texas Lottery Commission news release, continued) "When I finished screaming and hollering, the party was on," he said. "Word got out pretty quickly after that. I've even gotten calls from a few people I had not spoken with in a long time about accompanying me to a game, but it's all good because everyone has been great about congratulating me. The way I look at it, you've got to send in your non-winning tickets and never give up. This second-chance drawing was an opportunity. I took it, and it turned into a real blessing." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $86 million. The Lotto Texas® jackpot for Wednesday is an estimated $13 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $46 million.
