MEGA MILLIONS® GAME IS ABOUT TO GET BIGGER!
(AUSTIN) ­ Beginning Oct. 19, lottery players can buy tickets for a Mega Millions® game that features larger starting jackpots, faster growing jackpots, a million-dollar second prize and better odds of winning any prize--all for the same $1 players now pay.

"We think that players will respond favorably to the new Mega Millions changes and expect even greater sales for the game," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®.

Sales for the Texas Lottery's draw games, which include Mega Millions, totaled more than $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2013, contributing to record sales and revenue and to last year being the 10th consecutive year that the Texas Lottery generated more than $1 billion for the state. "Enthusiastic sales for Mega Millions and our other draw games help us continue to produce record results and increased funding for public education," said Grief.

Starting with the Oct. 22 drawing, Mega Millions players will see a minimum jackpot increase from $12 million to $15 million, and jackpots will grow by at least $5 million after each drawing in which the jackpot is not won.

In addition to larger minimum jackpots, changes to the game include: · · · The second tier prize for matching the first five numbers drawn will increase from $250,000 to $1 million. Faster growing jackpots. The Megaplier®, a multiplier option which players can purchase for an additional $1 to increase their non-jackpot prizes, will be expanded so that a Mega Millions ticket can win up to $5 million without matching all six numbers. · Better odds of winning any prize.
