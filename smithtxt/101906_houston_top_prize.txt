Houston Man Wins $50,000 Per Year For 10 Years With Top Prize $500,000 From The Texas Lottery®
(Austin, October 19) - Lonnell Sharp of Houston has claimed the top prize of $50,000 for 10 years after playing Top Prize $500,000 from the Texas Lottery®. "To tell the truth, I thought I had won $50,000," Sharp said. "And I didn't even believe that." Sharp says he's been playing a long time, but has never won anything like this. "I've won the $10 and $20 prizes, maybe a little more," he said. "With this I can get a new car and buy a house." "Disbelief is a common denominator among all claimants," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "With two more top prizes yet to be won in this popular $1 game, I'm sure we can expect to see more happily-stunned claimants come through our doors." Sharp purchased his ticket at N. B. Food Mart #131637, located at 6275 West Airport Boulevard in Houston. The winner requested minimum publicity.
