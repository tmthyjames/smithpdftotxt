LAST TICKET WINS AUSTIN RESIDENT $250,000 PRIZE IN BIG PAYOUT FROM TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Gregory Guerrero of Austin bought the one remaining Big Payout ticket he saw in the bin at the Texan Food Mart in Austin. "It's my system for buying scratch-off tickets," Guerrero said. "I always check to see if there's only one ticket remaining whenever I'm in a store that sells Lottery tickets, and that's the one I buy. Last Friday, I splurged and spent $10 on this ticket." Guerrero was en route to his parents' house when he saw the top prize on the ticket. "I got about 100 yards from the store and had to pull over," he said. "When I saw that prize, I couldn't keep driving. I had to stop and take a deep breath." His parents were elated for him, Guerrero said. His father told him to keep the ticket in his fireproof gun safe and gave him the key. "We had a great weekend, too, and not just because of this ticket," Guerrero said. "We had a big birthday party to celebrate my son's eighth birthday and my grandfather's 85th birthday. We even celebrated for my dog, which had a second birthday." Guerrero said he may put his winnings toward the purchase of a new home or simply put it in the bank and save it.

"Buying the last ticket in the bin proved to be a winning plan for Mr. Guerrero," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is the second top prize in this game to be awarded." Guerrero said after winning the $250,000 top prize in Big Payout, he might switch his game plan. "I think what I'll do from now on is buy one Lotto Texas ticket on Wednesday and Saturday and play the same set of numbers," he said. "Who knows, I might win." The store is located at 7612 Bluff Springs Road in Austin. Tomorrow night's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $76 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
