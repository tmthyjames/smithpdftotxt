WITH LAST TICKET ON ROLL, RIO VISTA MAN WINS $2.5 MILLION PRIZE IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER
(Austin) ­ Store clerks will say that some lottery players are superstitious, refusing to buy the last ticket on a roll. Raymond D Bigham of Rio Vista is not such a person. He returned to the store where he frequently buys Texas Lottery® tickets to get the last $500,000,000 Blockbuster straggler on the ticket roll, and it brought him $2.5 million.

"The store clerk tried to sell me that last ticket, but I bought something else and wound up winning some money," Bigham said. "I told him I'd get that last Blockbuster ticket off his hands. After I saw the prize and even after he ran it through the terminal, I didn't believe I had this prize. He told me to keep the win hush-hush. As a result I told only my wife and my brother-in-law, who has always said that if anybody in our family was going to win big, it was me."

News travels at the speed of light in Rio Vista, population 781. Bigham's phone was ringing the next morning at 7:15 with friends and neighbors wanting to know if it was true.

"I don't think the clerk kept it hush-hush," Bigham said. "I go to the same store every day, since it's about one minute from my home. The day after, I bought one of the new Wintergreen tickets with the $7 I'd won in another game and won $50," he said.

Bigham owns an auto repair shop in Rio Vista, a business his father started. Besides scratch-offs, he enjoys Daily 4TM, which recently brought him a prize of $2,400. He gave that prize to his parents to use as a down payment for a piece of property very close to his home. (more)

(Texas Lottery Commission news release, continued) "That's what we're going to do with some of our prize money, pay off that piece of land for my parents, pay our debts and save the rest, make it work for us," he said. "My `blow-it' money will go to buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. I'll be back to work tomorrow morning, too."

"Mr. Bigham certainly has big plans for his winnings, sharing his prize with his family, spending just a little on himself and saving the rest," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With today's claim, this $20 game now has four top prizes of $2.5 million left and 17 prizes at the next level of $1 million also up for grabs."

Boney Joes, 100 South Highway 174 in Rio Vista, sold the ticket. The store is now eligible for a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $86 million. The Lotto Texas® jackpot for tomorrow is an estimated $13 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $46 million.
