POWERBALL® QUICK PICK RESULTS
IN $200,000 WIN FOR NATIVE OF SPUR
(Austin) ­ When he saw the Powerball® jackpot surpass $100 million, long-time Texas Lottery® player Graden Bass of Spur decided to buy a ticket. "I bought one of the first tickets available in Dickens County," said Bass. "I've been playing the Texas Lottery since it started, not every day but pretty regular. Then I got to playing Powerball some. I saw the jackpot was over $100 million, and I thought I'd better buy a ticket." Bass purchased a Quick Pick ticket at the Allsup's #82 located at 322 W. Hill St. in Spur. "I went to church on Sunday. Then after church I went and got the printout of all the games. I took it home and sat looking at the Powerball ticket," explained Bass. The ticket ended up matching all five numbers (5-10-24-38-43) but not the Powerball (1) for the October 15 drawing, making it worth $200,000. "It is great to see such a loyal player win a significant prize in our newest drawing game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Texas Lottery players have been enjoying Powerball ever since sales began in January 2010." According to Bass, the key to winning is playing, or as he put it, "If you are going to dance, you have to get on the floor."
