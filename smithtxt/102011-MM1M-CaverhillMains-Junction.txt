MEGA MILLIONS® WITH MEGAPLIER® PRIZE OF
$1 MILLION CLAIMED BY JUNCTION GROUP
(Austin) ­ Two tickets matched all of the numbers drawn except for the Mega Ball in the September 9 Mega Millions® drawing. Because both tickets included the Megaplier® add-on feature, both prizes were raised from $250,000 to a guaranteed $1 million. James P. Larger of San Antonio claimed one of the $1 million prizes shortly after the drawing. Friday, Caverhill Mains, LLC, Roxanne C. Fargason, Manager, of Junction came forward to claim the other prize. The five numbers drawn were 7-12-19-23-31. The Mega Ball was 45. The Mini Mart 66, located at 344 Junction Highway in Kerrville, sold this winning ticket. This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Texas Two Step® drawing features an advertised jackpot of $1.05 million. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $48 million, and Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $148 million.
