RICHMOND RESIDENT AND FORMER FLORIDA SCHOOL TEACHER WINS $200,000 PLAYING POWERBALL®
(Austin) ­ Christopher Goosen of Richmond won $200,000 in last Saturday's Powerball® drawing, a prize that he says he believed he would eventually win, if not in Florida where he used to live, then here in his new home state.

"I saw the numbers in the Houston Chronicle first and then went to the Texas Lottery's website to make sure they were the same as in the paper," Goosen said. "Once I stopped shaking, I learned what I should do next from the website, promptly signed the ticket and found out where to go in Houston to collect my prize."

Goosen said he hid the ticket in his bedroom in the humidor underneath the cigars. The former Florida schoolteacher moved to Texas to be closer to his sister and widowed mother and may begin teaching in the Fort Bend school system next year. He plans to use his prize to complete the dental work he had started and will save the rest.

"Texas Lottery proceeds benefit public education in our state, and to have a former school teacher win a significant prize is especially fitting," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Lottery proceeds were dedicated to the Foundation School Fund during the 1997 legislative session, and our mission continues to be generating revenue for the Foundation School Fund in support of public education."

Goosen purchased the ticket at the HEB Food Store #596, 6711 S. Fry Road, Katy.
