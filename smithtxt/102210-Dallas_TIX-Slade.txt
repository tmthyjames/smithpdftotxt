LONG SHOT RINGS TRUE FOR HOUSTON MAN WHO WINS 2011 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS
(Austin) ­ Marcel Slade of Houston told his girlfriend that he had a "very, very long shot" at winning any prize in a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing, but he sent in his six non-winning Dallas Cowboys tickets anyway.

"You might as well send them in, even if you don't think you're going to win something," Slade said. "The odds might be long, but so what? You'll never know if you don't send in the tickets that didn't win."
Slade received a notice in the mail from the Texas Lottery® informing him of his prize, a pair of 2011 Dallas Cowboys season tickets, from the drawing held September 21.

"Yes, I was really excited when I opened the letter, and, yes, I told everybody I know about it," he said. "I plan to attend those games next year and my friends can't wait to go with me. I always tell people to keep playing. I'm still playing and still sending in the ones that don't win because I might just win again."

"Mr. Slade's win is from the first of the four second-chance drawings that are part of this game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The second one was held this week, so we'll have a new group of winners who will enjoy exciting prizes that include Dallas Cowboys gift cards, autographed player jerseys, 2011 season tickets and weekend and draft-day prize packages with top-of-the-line accommodations."
