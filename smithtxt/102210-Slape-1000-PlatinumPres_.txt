EL PASOAN PROCLAIMS, "LIGHTNING CAN STRIKE TWICE" WITH $1,000 PRIZE IN PLATINUM PRESENT
(Austin) ­ Dale Slape of El Paso could not wait to get to work Friday morning to tell his doubting friends that he had won big again with a prize of $1,000 in Platinum Present, a Texas Lottery® scratch-off.

"They've been telling me since I won the $50,000 prize in the State Fair of Texas scratch-off in September of 2007 that I would never win big again," Slape said. "Well, guess what, lightning can strike twice in the same place, and I've got the second big prize to prove it."

"This $1,000 prize is going to pay for a necessary weekend project at home," Slape said. "I'm going to buy all the materials I need first thing Saturday morning to build a fence around my two acres so my dog can run free. He is a stray springer spaniel mix I found nearly two years ago and he's a great dog. In a few days, he'll have lots of room to roam."

"Platinum Present is one of the scratch-offs in our holiday suite of games for 2010," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mr. Slape's $1,000 Platinum Present prize is one of 336 in this amount offered in the game that also has a top prize of $1 million, as well as second-tier prizes ranging from $10,000 to the break-even amount of $20. As Mr. Slape has shown, a player can win a significant prize more than once playing the Games of Texas."

Slape stopped in at the Circle K #6015 this morning and bought this ticket along with his coffee. The store is located at 12680 Montana Avenue in El Paso.
