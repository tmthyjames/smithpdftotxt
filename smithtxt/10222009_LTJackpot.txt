SELFSELF-SERVICE PURCHASE PURCHASE AT ALVIN HH-E-B RESULTS IN A WIN FOR MYSTERY LOTTO TEXAS® PLAYER
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas Lottery® officials are encouraging players in the Gulf Coast area to check their tickets after last night's Lotto Texas® drawing. One ticket matched all six numbers, 9 ­ 20 ­ 27 ­ 42 ­ 51 ­ 53. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased from a self-service terminal (SST) at the H-E-B Pantry Foods #288 located at 207 E. South Street in Alvin.

"SSTs have become increasingly popular with our players. Not only do these devices give players a convenient way to buy online tickets, they also have the ability to check whether tickets are winners," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "SSTs are currently available in about 850 locations, and retailers benefit from the added revenue they provide. In fact, this H-E-B store in Alvin is eligible for a $500,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket."

At $76 million, the advertised annuitized jackpot was the highest since the record-setting $145 million jackpot for June 19, 2004. Since the player selected the Cash Value Option (CVO), last night's winning ticket will pay a lump sum of $48,877,997.02.

This is not the only Lotto Texas jackpot available to claim, though. A CVO ticket worth $7,131,735.60 purchased at the Big Country Mart, 4624 Highway 1187 in Burleson, will expire November 2. That ticket matched the numbers drawn (4 ­ 14 ­ 21 ­ 29 ­ 34 ­ 43) for the May 6 drawing, which featured an advertised annuitized jackpot of $11 million.
