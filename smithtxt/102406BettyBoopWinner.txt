GOOD STUDY HABITS PAY OFF FOR AUSTIN BETTY BOOPTM TOP-PRIZE WINNER

(AUSTIN) ­ Austin's Dora Angeles is a well-informed Texas Lottery® player; so she always checks to find out which scratch-off games are more likely to have top prizes remaining before she buys a ticket. Angeles' homework paid off this week, and Tuesday she claimed a top cash prize ­ $30,000 ­ in the $2 Betty BoopTM scratch-off game. "All I really knew about the game was that it was pretty new and that most of the top prizes were probably still unclaimed," said Angeles. "I went home to scratch it and I jumped and screamed when I saw what I had, but I still didn't believe it until my husband and sister looked at it too."

As many players like Angeles know, the Texas Lottery updates its list of already-claimed scratch-off top prizes on its Web site on a weekly basis, and the same information is printed on flyers and distributed to all lottery retailers, as well. "There's no sure-fire way to pick a winning scratch-off ticket, but you can never be too informed, as Ms. Angeles can certainly attest," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "Regularly updated prize information is just the beginning of what players can learn about the Texas Lottery from our Web site, and I encourage everyone to take advantage of this valuable resource." Angeles said that prior to this week, the most she'd ever won was $500. She plans to use her new winnings to pay off some bills. In addition to the top prizes of $30,000, Betty Boop offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $2 to $2,000.
