POTEET ALL OR NOTHINGTM PLAYER WINS TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ The newest Texas Lottery® draw game, All or NothingTM, is already gaining fans around the state, including one enthusiast from Poteet. Steven J. Gill won $250,000 Tuesday night on his new favorite game. "I've never really lost," said Gill. "I really like the game. I usually at least win my money back." This week he did much more than that. His Quick Pick ticket matched all 12 numbers for a $250,000 top-prize win. "I was in real shock when I saw the numbers... I haven't been asleep since. That's one thing I found out. You don't sleep once you know you've won," said Gill. Gill purchased his ticket at the EZ Stop #4 located at 4015 S. Loop 1604 W. in San Antonio and said he plans to use his winnings to pay off his house. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $21 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $100 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $29 million.
