WACO BONUS BREAK THE BANK PLAYER FINDS $75,000 SILVER LINING ON A CLOUDY DAY

(AUSTIN) ­ Wednesday was a cloudy, stormy day in Central Texas, but Waco's Don A. Waddell saw nothing but blue skies on his drive to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin. Nothing could dampen his spirits that day, because he was in town to pick up the top prize ­ $75,000 ­ in the Bonus Break the Bank scratchoff game. "The traffic may have been heavy, but I really couldn't tell you," Waddell said. "I'm just so happy, nothing's going to spoil my day!" Wednesday wasn't Waddell's first brush with Texas Lottery luck. He said he also won $30,000 on another scratch-off ticket last year. Waddell said he plans to use his Bonus Break the Bank winnings to buy a new truck, and he'll probably put the rest in the bank.

"People really do win the Games of the Texas," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And sometimes, lucky players like Mr. Waddell really do win more than once!" In addition to the top prizes of $75,000, Bonus Break the Bank offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $7,500. Waddell purchased his ticket at the Quik Pack Food Store located at 4800 Bosque Blvd. in Waco.
