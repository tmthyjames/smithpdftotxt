AFTER $27,606 CASH FIVE® WIN, CEDAR PARK PLAYER ENVISIONS HIMSELF TOSSING AWAY THOSE GLASSES

(AUSTIN) ­ Pretty soon, Doug Smith of Cedar Park won't need his glasses to check his Texas Lottery® results every morning. Using family birthdays for good luck, he matched all five numbers in Tuesday night's Cash Five® drawing, and collected his $27,606 prize yesterday. The bespectacled Smith didn't hesitate when asked what he was going to do with his prize.

"The first thing I'm going to do is get LASIK eye surgery, so I can get rid of these glasses," said Smith. "We'll probably use the rest to pay some bills and maybe for a down payment on a car." Smith said he'd been using another set of numbers forever without hitting the jackpot, so he recently switched to family birthdays. The switch definitely paid off, and Smith has already bought his ticket for the next Cash Five drawing. "On behalf of the Texas Lottery, I want to congratulate Mr. Smith for his recent good luck and his soon-to-be-improved eyesight," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Anyone can see that with great odds and six drawings a week, Cash Five is yet another great option for Texas Lottery players." Cash Five drawings are held Monday through Saturday at 10:12 p.m. Players win by matching two, three, four or five of five numbers drawn from a field of 37. The overall odds of winning a prize in Cash Five are 1 in 8. Smith purchased his winning ticket at the Lakeline Food Stop located at 1075 North Lakeline Blvd. in Cedar Park. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $24 million and Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $13 million.
