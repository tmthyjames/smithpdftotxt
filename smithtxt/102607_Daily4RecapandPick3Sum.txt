DAILY 4TM LAUNCH SUCCESSFUL; PICK 3TM TO OFFER SUM IT UPTM FEATURE
(AUSTIN) ­ On September 30, the Texas Lottery® launched a brand new game, Daily 4TM with Sum It UpTM. According to unaudited numbers, the game and associated add-on feature brought in more than $5.2 million during the first three weeks of sales. Of that number, approximately $1.2 million came directly from sales of the Sum It Up add-on feature, which Pick 3® will also offer soon. "We are pleased with the sales numbers for Daily 4 with Sum It Up so far," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Sum It Up will also enhance Pick 3, providing a fun new way for players to win. By adding this feature to the Pick 3 game, we hope to generate even more money for the Foundation School Fund." Beginning November 11, players will have the option of wagering from 50 cents to $5 on the sum of their Pick 3 numbers. The Sum It Up add-on feature allows players to win if the sum of their three numbers matches the sum of the three numbers drawn, even if the numbers themselves do not match. For example, a player choosing the numbers 5 ­ 1 ­ 6 (Sum = 12) would win the Sum It Up prize if the numbers 4 ­ 0 ­ 8 (Sum = 12) are drawn. The base Pick 3 game will remain the same, and players can select the add-on feature in conjunction with any of the Pick 3 play types. Those who choose the Sum It Up option may win additional prizes from $3 to $2,500, depending upon the wager amount selected and the odds for the chosen sum.
