CORPUS CHRISTI RESIDENT WINS TOP PRIZE IN WEEKLY GRAND SCRATCH-OFF FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­ Charlotte D. Johnson of Corpus Christi has claimed the top prize of $1,000 per week for 20 years in Weekly Grand, a Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. At the end of the term, the prize totals $1,040,000.

Johnson is a private-duty nurse with a crunch-time schedule of three consecutive 16-hour days every week that she says she does not mind working to care for elderly patients.

"The way I look at it, I get three days off at the end of those days," she said. "I get to relax, sleep late, and really rest to do it again. I have been doing this for more than 20 years, and despite the hours, it has been very rewarding. I don't plan to quit, either."

Johnson had purchased the lone Weekly Grand ticket for her mother, who scratched and gave the ticket right back to her. "She said, `Here, baby, this is for you.' I can't even tell you how happy we all are. I'm going to pay off some debts and buy us a new home."

The new winner and her mother had already scheduled a trip to Las Vegas for November. "After winning this prize, the trip is going to be even more fun," Johnson said.

Weekly Grand is a consistently popular game among fans of scratch-off games, and has now been issued 22 times," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "After this claim, the game still has two more top prizes left. We congratulate Ms. Johnson on her win." (more)
