LAKE JACKSON RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION THANKS TO MEGAPLIER®
(AUSTIN) ­ When the Texas Lottery® introduced the Mega Millions® game in 2003, Texas became the first state to offer the Megaplier® add-on feature. For an extra $1, players get the chance to multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three or even four times. Does it pay to Megaply? For the Tomas Torres Living Trust of Lake Jackson, it certainly did. By choosing the additional wager, they raised their second-tier prize to a whopping $1 million. However, trust member Tomas Torres says he doesn't expect the money to change his lifestyle. He has always worked in a restaurant and plans to continue. "We have decided to give a portion to our church, because if we really did win, it was by God's will," he said in a written statement. "We still have to work and help our families in Mexico to live. But now, if we have really won, it will be a little easier if one of us gets sick and cannot work." Although calmer now, he admits to being pretty excited at first. "When they verified that we had won $1,000,000.00 because of the multiplier, all of us almost fainted," he wrote.

He goes on to say that he was in shock for several days, adding that his wife still does not believe it, and that his sister-in-law suspects someone made a mistake. It's no mistake. Mr. Torres' sister-in-law walked into the Wag a Bag #2 located at 95 Oak Drive in Lake Jackson, and purchased a Quick Pick for the September 14 Mega Millions drawing. The ticket matched the five numbers drawn 5 ­ 9 ­ 12 ­ 33 ­ 40, but not the Mega Ball. While this would normally qualify them for the $250,000 prize, their decision to Megaply multiplied their prize to $1 million because the Megaplier four was drawn. "Not only does Megaplier increase the number of million-dollar winners in the state, the feature contributes millions of dollars in sales every year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "By providing innovative game features, the agency strives to support Texas education, through contributions to the Foundation School Fund." Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $53 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $15 million.
