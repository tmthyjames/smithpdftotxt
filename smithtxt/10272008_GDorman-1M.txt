NORTH TEXAS RESIDENT BECOMES FIRST OF FIVE $1 MILLION WINNERS IN TEXAS $50 MILLION CLUB
(AUSTIN) ­ It took only 10 days for the first $1 million to be awarded in the new Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Texas $50 Million Club. George B. Dorman of Nevada, Texas, claimed the first top prize at the Dallas Claim Center. "I was at a Valero station in Wiley when I scratched the ticket, but I couldn't believe it. I was in my truck so I threw the ticket up on the dash and figured I'd just missed something. I had some other $5 tickets, and I started scratching those," said Dorman. "Then I couldn't take it anymore. I had to take that ticket and get it checked out. That's when they told me I'd won." Dorman called his daughter right away but says he waited until his claim was official before telling his wife. Asked about his plans for his winnings, Dorman indicates she may have more say than he does.

"I told her she ain't getting any," he joked. "She told me we'll talk about that when I get home." A fan of instant games, Dorman tries out a variety of tickets and says he's played the Texas $50 Million Club since its introduction earlier this month. The game offers more than $51.4 million in prizes and overall odds of one in 2.88, including break-even prizes. Four top prizes of $1 million each remain unclaimed. Dorman purchased his ticket at the Valero Corner Store #1770, 801 S. Westgate Way in Wylie. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million.
