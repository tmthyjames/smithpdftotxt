SAN ANTONIO CONTEST FAN WINS 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING DALLAS COWBOYS 2010 SEASON TICKETS
(AUSTIN) ­To hear Jodye Pastuch of San Antonio tell it, she'd enter a contest to get a chance to enter a contest. She entered her non-winning Dallas Cowboys scratch-off tickets in a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing, which ended up winning her a prize of Dallas Cowboys 2010 season tickets. "I love contests, and I love entering them," Pastuch said. "I had tickets in the first second-chance drawing, hoping I might win a Cowboys jersey, but nothing happened, so I made sure to enter the second one." Pastuch learned of her prize from a message on her answering machine. It sounded so official and confident that she believed right away she indeed had won. "There was enough detail in what the Lottery man on the phone said that I knew it had to be true," she said. "The first thing I did was yell out a big `Yay!' The second thing was that I ran back out to my boyfriend's car to let him know about the tickets. He got pretty excited, too, since now he's going to see some football games." Pastuch says she told a few people about winning the season-tickets prize. "Even people I don't know come up to me and congratulate me," she said. "Everybody knows about it, but that's OK. We're already planning how we're going to get to each game next year." "Ms. Pastuch is one of many Dallas Cowboy fans who have really enjoyed playing this particular game," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We are very pleased that she will be able to cheer her team on in person next season." The top cash prize in the Dallas Cowboys game is $100,000. Nine of the 13 $100,000 prizes remain unclaimed. The next second-chance drawing for the Dallas Cowboys game will be held November 17. Players who wish to enter the drawings can fill out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affix a first-class stamp and place the ticket in the mail.
