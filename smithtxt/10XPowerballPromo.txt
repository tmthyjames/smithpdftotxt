TEXAS LOTTERY® ROLLS OUT POWER PLAY® 10X PROMOTION WITH PRIZES UP TO $2 MILLION
(Austin) ­ Powerball® rolled into Texas on January 31, and now the Texas Lottery® is rolling out the first Power Play® promotion for Texans who play the newest multi-million dollar jackpot game. For a limited time, players who choose the Power Play option could win as much as $2 million. For an extra $1 per play, the Power Play option gives players the chance to increase their nongrand/jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times. Beginning Saturday, May 1, the 10X multiplier will be added. If drawn, it will allow players who selected the Power Play option to multiply their non-grand/jackpot winnings by 10 times. The attached chart shows the 10X prize amount for each prize level. The Power Play multiplier does not apply to the Powerball grand/jackpot prize. The 10X multiplier can be drawn multiple times during the promotion. If a 10X is not drawn during the promotional period May 1-29, then the promotion will continue until a 10X is drawn. "The Texas Lottery was thrilled to add Powerball to our game mix in January," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "This Power Play promotion will bring additional excitement and entertainment to our lottery players by providing them with the chance to multiply their non-grand/jackpot winnings by up to 10 times."
