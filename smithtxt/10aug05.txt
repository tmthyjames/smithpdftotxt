I Love Lucy® Scratch Game Holds More Than Just Nostalgia For Georgetown Lottery Player

Mary Baranowski is an even bigger I Love Lucy fan since claiming her $20,000 top cash prize for the popular instant ticket game

(Austin, August 10) - According to Mary Baranowski of Georgetown, she and her husband were sitting quietly in their kitchen Saturday evening, both enjoying scratching away at Texas Lottery® I LOVE LUCY® instant tickets she had purchased earlier from her favorite lottery retailer. The nostalgia for Lucille Ball's famous face on the games is what Baranowski says turned her on to buying them. "I always like to buy the newest tickets, and I have always loved Lucy," she said. "Now, I really love Lucy, since I won $20,000." Baranowski purchased her top prize winning ticket at Jiffy Mart #4, located at 3816 Williams Drive #B in Georgetown.

"The I LOVE LUCY scratch game has brought a lot of smiles to our players' faces due to the scenes from the I Love Lucy shows featured on the tickets," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "And, undoubtedly Mrs. Baranowski walked away with a big smile on her face as she claimed the top cash prize of $20,000. We can still produce more grins and giggles for players, though, as there are 12 more top prizes left to claim." The I LOVE LUCY® scratch game features cash prizes from $2 to $20,000. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.25. Baranowski said she plans to buy some new furniture, pay off credit cards, and take her husband on a cruise. "I may splurge a little on buying some more lottery tickets," she added.
