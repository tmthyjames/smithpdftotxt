It's An Early Birthday Celebration For Fort Worth Texas Lottery® Scratch Game Winner
(Austin, March 17) - Laquita Moore of Fort Worth is going to celebrate her birthday a month early, and she's been assisted in her revelry with a $50,000 cash prize from the Texas Lottery® Casino Bingo scratch game. "I'm so happy. I turn 40 next month, so don't you just know I'm getting me something for my birthday," Moore said. "I waited until I got home and scratched my Casino Bingo game, and when I saw I won, I started screaming and hollering." Moore purchased her top prize-winning ticket at Niyala's Fina, located at 6601 Brentwood Stair Road in Fort Worth. "Lottery players have been making their own fun while Spring Break is going on," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "Our prizes create a lot of the same excitement as Ms. Moore exhibited, no matter at what level they win, it seems." Moore told lottery officials she plans to pay off some bills and put some in the bank for the future.
