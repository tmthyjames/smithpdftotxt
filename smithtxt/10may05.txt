Taylor Resident Wins Top Cash Prize For Texas Lottery® Pure Gold Scratch Game
(Austin, May 4) - Yvette Huff of Taylor waited a few days to make her week a 'purely' exciting one. Saturday evening, Huff purchased a Texas Lottery® PURE GOLD scratch game, and realized she might be holding a top prize-winning ticket. "I called a friend of mine to come over and double-check," Huff said. "I wanted to come claim my prize yesterday, but my job needed me to be there, so I waited until today. I'm not sure yet what I plan to do with the money." Huff claimed her $20,000 prize at Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin. She purchased her ticket at the Lake Drive Texaco, at 312 West Lake Drive in Taylor. "Something just told me to get that ticket," Huff explained. "I play every other day or so, and win $5 or $20 here and there. This is the most I've ever won." "Sometimes that little inner voice nails it right on the head," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "In this case, Ms. Huff nailed the tenth top prize awarded for the PURE GOLD scratch game. That means, as of today, there are still two more $20,000 prizes left unclaimed." PURE GOLD also features other cash prizes ranging from $2 to $2,000. "I plan to keep on scratching," said Huff.
