LUBBOCK RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Derek Salinas of Lubbock claimed a Mega Millions second-tier prize worth $1,000,001. The ticket was purchased at the 7-Eleven #410 located at 8109 Indiana Avenue in Lubbock for the Nov. 4 drawing. The claimant requested minimal publicity.

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
