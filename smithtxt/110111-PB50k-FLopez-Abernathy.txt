ABERNATHY POWERBALL® WINNER DECIDES $50,000 TICKET WORTH A SECOND LOOK
(Austin) ­ When he first checked his Quick Pick ticket for the October 29 Powerball® drawing, Felipe Lopez Jr. of Abernathy told his wife he thought he'd won $500. She didn't believe it and told him he better look again to make sure. He did, and as it turned out, he realized he had matched 4 of 5 numbers plus the Powerball. Since he'd also added the Power Play® feature for a dollar extra, what would have been a $10,000 prize was now worth $50,000 because the Power Play number was 5. Lopez claimed his prize Monday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Lubbock. "We'd have been more than happy with a $500 prize, but $50,000 is really something" said Lopez. "I don't always remember to buy lottery tickets, but this just goes to show that you never know." Lopez said he and his wife plan to use some of their winnings to pay off some bills, and the parents of two teenagers plan to put the rest into savings. "Not every player will win a $50,000 Powerball prize like Mr. Lopez, but he did have plenty of winning company," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "He was one of just under 73,000 Texas Powerball prize winners and one of more than 12,800 Power Play winners in the October 29 drawing alone." Lopez purchased his ticket at Allsup's #73 located at 512 Avenue D in Abernathy.
