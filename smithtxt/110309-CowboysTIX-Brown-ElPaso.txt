EL PASO COWBOYS FAN WITH HISTORY OF SUPPORTING TEAM WINS SEASON TICKETS IN 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­Long-time Dallas Cowboys fan Bobby Brown of El Paso grew up in Dallas going to Cowboys games with his family, first at the Cotton Bowl and then at Texas Stadium. The prize of 2010 season tickets that he won in a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing is extra special to this Cowboys super fan. "After I joined the US Army, I stayed connected to the team in any way I could," he said. "I took my family to training camps in Austin while I was stationed at Fort Hood in Killeen, and I was even in charge of the security escort for the Cowboy cheerleaders during their visit to the troops in Bosnia in 1996." Brown said he and his wife started playing the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game as a way to have fun with the team. "We never dreamed we'd win season tickets," he said. "My sister summed it up best by saying, `They could not have picked a better fan!' We look forward to going to every game in 2010. Go Cowboys!" "The Dallas Cowboys inspire enormous loyalty in their fans, as Mr. Brown has shown, so it's especially gratifying to award this prize to him," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We're pleased not just for him but also for the Cowboys who will have one of their super fans in the stands cheering them on next year." The top cash prize in the Dallas Cowboys game is $100,000. Eight of the 13 $100,000 prizes remain unclaimed. The next second-chance drawing for the Dallas Cowboys game is scheduled for November 17. Players who wish to enter the drawings can fill out the back of each nonwinning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affix a first-class stamp and place the ticket in the mail. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $50 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $7 million.
