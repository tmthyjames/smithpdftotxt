AUSTIN LEGAL ENTITY CLAIMS $16 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT FROM LAST SATURDAY
(Austin) ­ Tesoro Delrey Revocable Trust, Virginia I. Hermosa, Trustee, of Austin today claimed the $16 million advertised Lotto Texas® jackpot in last Saturday's drawing. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option (CVO), which gives the winner a total prize of $10,961,350.40 before taxes.

Stripes #9793, 1544 Palm Boulevard, in Brownsville sold the ticket. This makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, which is $160,000.

This is the sixth Lotto Texas jackpot-winning ticket sold in Brownsville since sales began in November of 1992. The numbers selected in last Saturday's drawing were 44-54-46-8-34-37. In last night's Cash Five® drawing, one of the two top prize tickets worth $11,198 was also sold in Brownsville at the Stripes #2156, 2255 University Boulevard.

The trustee of the legal entity claiming today's prize requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. The Lotto Texas jackpot for Saturday is an estimated $5 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $123 million.
