HAPPY HOLIDAYS AHEAD FOR $1 MILLION METROPLEX MERRY MILLIONS WINNER
(AUSTIN) ­ Shelanie J. Muilenburg of Fort Worth is looking forward to the holidays even more than usual this year after claiming the third of five $1 million top prizes in the $20 Merry Millions scratch-off game last Thursday at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Fort Worth. Muilenburg is an avid Texas Lottery player who prefers scratch-offs so she won't have to wait to see if she's won. "I just decided to buy a bigger ticket," said Muilenburg. "I did and it paid off!" Muilenburg has a variety of plans for her winnings, including buying a new house and car, paying off her bills, starting a business and investing the rest. Muilenburg purchased her ticket at the 7-Eleven #34098 located at 6550 Forest Hill Drive in Forest Hill. The retailer is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. "Congratulations and happy holidays to Ms. Muilenburg," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Merry Millions is just one of our popular holiday scratch-offs for our players to choose from at price points to fit any budget." In addition to the two remaining top prizes of $1 million, the Merry Millions game also offers thousands of lower-tier prizes from $20 to $10,000. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.03, including break-even prizes. Other holiday-themed scratch-off games currently available from the Texas Lottery include the $1 Holiday Greetings, the $2 Holiday Break the Bank, the $3 Jingle Bell Crossword, the $5 Nutcracker Cash and the $10 Holiday Doubler.
