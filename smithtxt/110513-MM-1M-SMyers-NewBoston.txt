CHANGES TO MEGA MILLIONS® MEAN MEGA WINNERS IN TEXAS, INCLUDING LATEST $1 MILLION CLAIMANT FROM NEW BOSTON
(AUSTIN) ­ Since Oct. 22, Texas Lottery® players have enjoyed a Mega Millions® game that features larger starting jackpots, faster growing jackpots, and better odds of winning any prize-- all for the same $1 per play as always. Then last Friday, Nov. 1, two separate tickets matched all five numbers, but not the Mega Ball for second-tier prizes worth $1 million each. Shawn Myers of New Boston claimed a $1 million prize at the Texas Lottery claim center in Tyler today. The Murphy USA, located at 860 James Bowie Drive in New Boston, sold him the lucky ticket. The claimant requested minimum publicity. The owner of a second $1 million ticket sold at the Stripes No. 27, 1000 N. Front in Fort Stockton, has yet to come forward. In addition to larger minimum jackpots, changes to the game include:    The second tier prize for matching the first five numbers drawn increased from $250,000 to $1 million. Faster growing jackpots. The Megaplier®, a multiplier option which players can purchase for an additional $1 to increase their non-jackpot prizes, was expanded so that a Mega Millions ticket can win up to $5 million without matching all six numbers. Better odds of winning any prize.
