AUSTIN-AREA RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION POWERBALL PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Kevin Kruckemeyer, of Pflugerville, claimed a Powerball® second-tier prize worth $1,000,000. The ticket for the drawing held on Wednesday, Oct. 23, was purchased at Honest Food Mart located at 8400 Burnet Road in Austin.

Kruckemeyer matched all of the numbers drawn, (3-23-31-34-47) but not the Powerball number (13). One ticket sold in California did match all six numbers for the $216 million jackpot.
