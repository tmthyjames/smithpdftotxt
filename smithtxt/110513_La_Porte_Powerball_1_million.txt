LA PORTE RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION POWERBALL PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Rhonda Carraway, of La Porte, claimed a Powerball® ticket worth $1,000,004 on Monday. The ticket for the drawing held on Wednesday, Oct. 23, was purchased at Mr. Jake's Food Mart located at 1066 Forest Park Blvd. in Fort Worth.

Carraway matched all of the numbers drawn, (3-23-31-34-47) but not the Powerball number (13). One ticket sold in California did match all six numbers for the $216 million jackpot. Carraway also matched at lower prize levels for an additional $4 on the same ticket.

The claimant requested minimum publicity.
