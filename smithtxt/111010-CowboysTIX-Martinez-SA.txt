SAN ANTONIAN WINS 2011 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS IN A SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Vincent Martinez of San Antonio dutifully entered his four non-winning Dallas Cowboys tickets in a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing and didn't look back, that is, until last week when his wife called him in California to tell him he had mail from the lottery. The letter had news he never thought he would see, that he had won a pair of tickets to the entire at-home Dallas Cowboys 2011 season.

"It's hard to believe, but I really won," Martinez said. "Last year, I won $500 playing the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off that was out then, but didn't win in the second-chance drawings. Next year, I'm going to make all the games and take a different person with me each time."

After his wife gave him the good news, Martinez shared the happy information with his co-driver, who may be making the trek next year to the new stadium in Arlington to share in this prize. Martinez is a truck driver with a wholesale nursery and floral company.

"Texas has a long and storied football tradition, which makes this prize all the more special to the winners," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "This and the other excitement-generating prizes offered in the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off have made our players fans of the game and our second-chance drawings." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $6 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. There is more information about the Texas Lottery available on the official website at www.txlottery.org. ###
