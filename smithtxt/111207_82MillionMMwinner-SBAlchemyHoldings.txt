CORRECTION
DALLAS LEGAL ENTITY CLAIMS $82.5 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT FROM AUGUST 31 DRAW
(AUSTIN) ­SB Alchemy Holdings, Ltd., of Dallas has claimed a jackpot prize of $82.5 million, one quarter of the August 31 $330 million Mega Millions® jackpot, which was shared with three other tickets sold outside Texas. "We're glad to see the Texas claimant has at last come in to take a share of one of the highest-ever Mega Millions jackpots," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We were concerned when we didn't hear anything from anyone for nearly two months because several years ago a $13 million Lotto Texas ticket purchased in Humble was not claimed by the 180-day deadline, so there's some history there to give us pause to think. A few weeks ago, however, we got the call, and we're happy to award this prize." The ticket was sold through a self-service terminal (SST) situated in the Kroger #318, 19300 West Lake Houston Parkway, in Humble. The numbers drawn were 8-18-22-40-44, and the Mega Ball was 11. The value of this annual-payments-option ticket is $82,500,000 over 26 years, and was paid with an initial payment of $3,175,000 and continues with 25 annual payments of $3,173,000. "I requested a photograph of the ticket before I was willing to get too far into this," I. Scott Carter, representative of the legal entity, said of his client that claimed the prize. "You always want to ensure you can check the ticket on the Lottery's Web site to get a solid idea about its veracity." Carter said his client decided to "go south" to celebrate getting the prize.

"As a result of the Texas and Texas Tech game this weekend, you couldn't find a hotel room in Austin to save your life," Carter said. "The winner was in San Antonio to enjoy the Riverwalk and to celebrate receiving the prize." Carter said his client preferred to do only minimal publicity and chose him to speak on its behalf. This Friday, Lottery officials will participate in a public ceremonial check presentation with administrators of the Kroger Food Store in Humble. The store has received $825,000, the one-percent bonus share of the jackpot prize, to which the store is entitled for having sold this ticket. This prize award was the last to be collected by the four claimants that divided the $330 million jackpot. The remaining prizes for the tickets that were sold in Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey were claimed in September. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $24 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $21 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
