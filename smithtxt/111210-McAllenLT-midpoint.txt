MCALLEN LOTTO TEXAS® TICKET SOLD IN AUGUST PASSES MIDWAY POINT TO 180-DAY DEADLINE TO CLAIM
(Austin) ­A Lotto Texas® ticket sold in McAllen for the drawing on August 11 and worth $6 million has now passed the midway point to the 180-day deadline to claim the jackpot.

"To date, the agency has not had one inquiry about this ticket," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We always encourage our players to take care with their tickets, to sign them immediately after purchase and keep them in a safe place. If the ticket remains unclaimed, the money will be placed in the Unclaimed Prize Fund, which benefits other state programs."

The ticket reached the noteworthy marker this week. Express Business Services, located at 1501 W. US Highway 83, Suite 112, in McAllen sold the ticket. This retailer has already received the accompanying retailer bonus, which is equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, $60,000.

The numbers drawn were 4-21-24-40-43-48. The ticket was a Quick Pick and sold with the Cash Value Option, which makes it worth $4.1 million before taxes. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $7 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $25 million. There is more information about the Texas Lottery® available on the official website at www.txlottery.org. ###
