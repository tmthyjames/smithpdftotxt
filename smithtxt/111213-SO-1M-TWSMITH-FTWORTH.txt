FORT WORTH TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER WINS TWICE IN LESS THAN NINE MONTHS, CLAIMS 20X CASH $1 MILLION TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­T. W. Smith of Fort Worth made his second trip to the Texas Lottery® claim center in less than nine months to claim a major prize. The scratch-off fan won $1,000 in February. Then he returned today to claim a $1 million top prize in the 20X Cash game, but Smith says he's not done winning just yet. "I'm at the store right now trying to scratch-off another win," said Smith. Smith prefers scratch-off tickets but says there is no special secret to winning. "I just go with the new ones. Whenever a new game comes out, I'll try it." This attention to new games may be the reason that Smith became the first person to claim a $1 million top prize in the new 20X Cash game. Four top prizes currently remain unclaimed. "Many winners have a special system they think will improve their chances, but sometimes the simplest ideas work out the best," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "Texas education remains the big winner, though, with more than $15 billion in lottery revenue going to the Foundation School Fund since 1997." This $20 game features more than $76 million in total prizes. Overall odds of winning any 20X Cash prize, including break-even prizes, are one in 3.05. Smith purchased his lucky ticket at the EZ Mart #489, 100 E. Bardin Road in Arlington, making the store eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus.
