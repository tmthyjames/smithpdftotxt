DREAM COMES TRUE FOR LONG-TIME DALLAS COWBOYS FAN WITH 2011 SEASON TICKETS
(Austin) ­ Sandra E. Guzman of El Paso called it "a dream come true" to have the opportunity to watch the Dallas Cowboys play in their new stadium in Arlington. She won a pair of 2011 season tickets to the Dallas Cowboys home games through a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing.

"The Dallas Cowboys have always been a part of my Sunday since I can remember," Guzman said. "I entered the Dallas Cowboys tickets that didn't win hoping I might get a jersey or just anything from the second-chance drawing. I had to try. Then I got the letter from the lottery. I couldn't believe it."

"Our second-chance drawings have so many exciting prizes that all our winners can hardly believe not only that they have won, but what they've won," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Thanks to the generosity and can-do attitude of the Dallas Cowboys organization, our second-chance drawings with all that they offer bring an added level of excitement to the scratch-off game."

Guzman said she hasn't gotten past being excited and thrilled. "To think that I'm going to be in the new stadium next year watching `my' team play really is a dream that came true for me. Now I can hardly wait for next season." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $8 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $35 million.
