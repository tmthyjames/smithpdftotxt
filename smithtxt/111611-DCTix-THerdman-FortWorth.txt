FORT WORTH RESIDENT WINS AGAIN IN TEXAS LOTTERY® SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ In April, Thomas Herdman of Fort Worth claimed a trip to Las Vegas he won in a second-chance drawing for The Price Is Right®. Then he won a pair of season tickets in the Dallas Cowboys drawing held October 12, and he says he's not done yet. "I should see you again real soon for the new Elvis ticket. I've already entered a few tickets for that drawing coming up in December." All eight top prizes of $20,000 remain unclaimed in the ElvisTM game, which was introduced this week. The Dallas Cowboys game still has 19 top prizes of $100,000 remaining unclaimed. Players who don't win instantly can enter their non-winning tickets in the second-chance drawings for each game by visiting www.txlottery.org/luckzone. "Send in your second-chance tickets. It worked twice for me," said Herdman. "The games featuring second-chance drawings remain popular with our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Everyone gets a second chance to win with the Dallas Cowboys, Elvis and Houston Texans games." Herdman purchased his Dallas Cowboys ticket at the Quik Sak #7, located at 8801 Clifford St. in White Settlement. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $46 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $23 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $40 million.
