TEAM ROPER LASSOS $100,000 TOP PRIZE WITH SINGLE DALLAS COWBOYS SCRATCH-OFF TICKET
(Austin) ­ When Robert Wheeler of Bandera stopped at the local Super S Foods, he received $5 in change, just enough to buy a single Dallas Cowboys ticket. That scratch-off could take him all the way to Las Vegas next month, but he's not necessarily going for the casinos or the shows.

"The machine was there between the counter and the door, so I put that $5 in," said Wheeler. "I went out to my truck and scratched the ticket. When I saw that $100,000, I knew right away. I said, `I'm taking a vacation.'" The 51st Wrangler National Finals Rodeo will be held December 3-12 in Las Vegas, and Wheeler, a team roper himself, says he'll use part of his winnings to attend. He also plans to start a college fund for his grandson.

Wheeler purchased his Dallas Cowboys ticket from the Super S Foods #302 located at 907 N. Main in Bandera. The ticket revealed the seventh $100,000 prize in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. Six top prizes remain unclaimed, and overall odds to win any cash prize are one in 3.85, including break-even prizes.
