THANKSGIVING COMES EARLY FOR DEL VALLE WEEKLY GRAND WINNER
(AUSTIN) ­ On Friday, Maria del Carmen Aguilar of Del Valle claimed the top prize ­ $1,000 a week for 20 years ­ in the Texas Lottery® Weekly Grand (Game #699) scratch-off game. "I really didn't believe it when I first looked at the ticket," said Aguilar. "Now, I'm just so happy and thankful for this blessing." The $2 Weekly Grand debuted in 1995 and Aguilar is the 77th player to claim the game's top prize. The total amount of the prize before taxes is $1,040,000. "This should be an especially memorable Thanksgiving for Ms. Aguilar and we're all excited for her," said Anthony J. Sadberry, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission.
