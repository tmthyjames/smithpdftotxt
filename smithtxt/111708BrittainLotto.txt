CENTER RESIDENT COLLECTS LOTTO TEXAS® PRIZE WITH CVO VALUE OF $4.2 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­The month of November began with a big surprised inhale for Gerald Brittain of Center. His Lotto Texas® ticket matched the six numbers from the drawing on Saturday, November 1st, winning him $4.2 million. His was the sole ticket that matched the numbers drawn: 9--10--12-- 17--37--51. Brittain purchased the ticket with the Cash Value Option (CVO), which brought the advertised $7 million jackpot prize total to $4,283,286, before the required 25 percent federal tax is taken out. Brittain bought his one Quick Pick ticket at Food Fast/Short Stop #10, 607 San Augustine, in Center. For selling this jackpot-winning ticket, the retailer is eligible to receive a prize of $70,000, the designated retailer bonus equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot. The new winner requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow night's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $8 million.
