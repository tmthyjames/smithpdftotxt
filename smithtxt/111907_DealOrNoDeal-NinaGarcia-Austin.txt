AUSTINITE WINS TOP PRIZE OF $1 MILLION IN DEAL OR NO DEAL FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­Nina Garcia of Austin has claimed the top prize of $1 million in the Texas Lottery® scratch-off game, Deal Or No Deal. "The winner claimed the first of the four top prizes the game offers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "We reissued the game in early September. With prizes ranging from $1 million to $100,000 to $50,000 down to the break-even amount of $5, we expect to see Deal Or No Deal turn into one of our most popular games. In fact, to date, 10 of the 20 $10,000 prizes have already been claimed. It's definitely a game with a high popularity quotient, especially since the prizes available for the game total $23.7 million." Garcia purchased the ticket at the C-Mart Food Store #2, 7811 S. First Street in Austin. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this top-prize-winning ticket. Ms. Garcia requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $41 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $23 million.
