HOUSTON TEXANS 2011 AND 2012 SEASON TICKETS INCLUDED IN CHANDLER RESIDENT'S PRIZE PACKAGE
(Austin) ­ Robbie Reece of Chandler called it "amazing" and said his family was "in awe" of winning the Houston Texans VIP 2011 and 2012 Season Tickets Prize Package from the Texas Lottery®. He entered his non-winning Houston Texans scratch-off tickets in a second-chance drawing.

"I didn't know if I would win, but I sent in the tickets anyway," Reece said. "This prize is a much bigger deal than the dollar value it has, it's really an amazing thing to win when you think that only 10 entries got this prize in this drawing."

Reece said his family was "shocked" at the news in the letter from the lottery, even though something similar occurred in 2009. "Last year, my son won a $500 gift card in a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing, and we thought that was incredible. "

In addition to the tickets, he also won a Texans merchandise bag with two Texans hats and t-shirts, and he will have $50 in Texans Bucks to spend as he pleases on concessions or merchandise or both. Reece also gets pre-game sideline passes during a pre-season game and two invitations to the hospitality tent during a Texans training camp practice.

"Our second-chance drawings are hugely popular with our players and we get thousands of entries for each one," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mr. Reece and a friend or family member are in for a great Houston Texans experience."
