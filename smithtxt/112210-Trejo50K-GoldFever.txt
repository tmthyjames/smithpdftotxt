EL CAMPO WOMAN WINS $50,000 TOP PRIZE AFTER BUYING "NEW" SCRATCH-OFF FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­ Enedina J. Trejo of El Campo always asks for the latest scratch-off games when she buys a Texas Lottery® ticket. It was lucky for her before and it was again last Wednesday when she bought one Gold Fever scratch-off that gave her a top prize of $50,000.

"I always ask for the new games, and I asked for Gold Fever again because the night before I was in the same store, bought one, and won $100," she said. "But I didn't have my glasses on when I scratched the ticket in the car, so I wasn't sure what I had won. All I could see was a bunch of zeros. When the clerk checked it for me, I knew I must have won something big because she opened her mouth in surprise, but no sound came out." Trejo called the office to say she would be a few minutes late, just enough time to collect herself. She is a bus driver with the local school district, and told lottery officials she "drove on a cloud" the rest of the day.

"Gold Fever was issued in mid-September with six top prizes of $50,000," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Ms. Trejo's top prize is the third claimed in this $5 game. Proceeds from the sale of our lottery tickets are sent to the Foundation School Fund to benefit public education."

Trejo's plans for her prize are simple, pay bills and save the rest. "I'll be able to finish paying on the house and pay off some bills," she said. "I'll save some for myself, but I've got 14 grandchildren and this prize showed up right before I have to do some Christmas shopping for them. I feel blessed to have gotten this prize, but it would not have happened if I had not played. There was a lucky number out there for me." (more)
