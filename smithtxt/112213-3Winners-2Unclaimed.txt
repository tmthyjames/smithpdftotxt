TEXAS LOTTERY® CREATES THREE NEW MILLIONAIRES THIS WEEK, STILL SEARCHING FOR TWO OTHERS Winners in Frisco, Spring and Tomball
(AUSTIN) ­ Three Texans claimed Texas Lottery® prizes of $1 million or more this week, but two large prizes still remain unclaimed. Gerald Lee Brady of Frisco claimed a Texas Two Step® jackpot worth $1.15 on Monday. His ticket was the only one to match all four numbers (16 ­ 17 ­ 23 ­ 33) and the Bonus Ball 35 for the Nov. 14 drawing. Timothy D. Galligan of Spring and Rigoberto Montanez-Ramirez of Tomball each collected $1 million top prizes from Texas Lottery scratch-off games. All of the retailers are eligible for $10,000 retailer bonuses for selling these winning tickets. Texas Lottery officials are still looking for two additional millionaires, as well. A Lotto Texas® ticket matched all six numbers (21 ­ 23 ­ 29 ­ 44 ­ 47 ­ 53), making it worth the $12,506,474.87 cash value of the $19 million jackpot from July 31. Similarly, a Powerball® ticket matched all five number drawn (5 ­ 25 ­ 30 ­ 58 ­ 59) but not the Powerball (32) for the Aug. 7 drawing, making it worth $1 million. Both tickets are set to expire early in 2014 if no winner comes forward.
