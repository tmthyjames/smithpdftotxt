LOYAL MONTHLY BONUS PLAYER WINS BIG
(Austin) ­ The Segura Family General Partnership, David Segura, Managing Partner, of Mathis claimed the second of four Monthly Bonus top prizes worth $10,000 per month for the next 20 years. Segura enjoys a variety of Texas Lottery® games, and his favorite is Monthly Bonus. "I scratched the tickets at the kitchen table," said Segura. "When I saw that dollar, I started shaking. I couldnt believe it. I even went to my neighbor and asked him to look at it. I said, ,,Pinch me and see if Im awake." Now that the reality of his win has set in, Segura wants to take a little time to relax. "Im going to take a month vacation, but my boss isnt too happy about it. He told me Id better not quit. Ill keep working until I win again." "This is the eighth edition of Monthly Bonus, and the game continues to be popular among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With more than $52 million in prizes, its easy to see why Mr. Segura would enjoy this scratch-off." For selling the winning ticket, Hoffs Food Stop, located at 512 S. Aransas St. in Mathis, is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. Tonights Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $25 million. Fridays Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $55 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit www.txlottery.org. ###
