SECOND-CHANCE DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS MAKE PERFECT ANNIVERSARY GIFT
(Austin) ­ A Texas Lottery® player for the last 10 years, Krystal Luna of Saginaw says winning season tickets in a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing felt "amazing," and it sounds like her husband would agree. "I'm going to give them to my husband as an anniversary gift," said Luna. "He's a big football fan. He thought I was lying at first. Then I showed him the letter." Luna won a pair of season tickets between the 30-yard lines for every Dallas Cowboys home game next season. "I'm probably going to go to one game to see the new stadium. My husband's never been, and he's got people coming out of the woodwork wanting to go with him," she said. The $5 Dallas Cowboys game has 19 instant-win top prizes of $100,000 each remaining unclaimed. Overall odds are one in 3.67, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can enter their non-winning tickets in the second-chance drawings online at www.txlottery.com/luckzone. Asked if she has any advice for other players, Luna answered, "Play responsibly." "I want to congratulate Mrs. Luna on her win and her wisdom," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We continually remind our players to enjoy our games responsibly, and it certainly worked for this Dallas Cowboys player."
