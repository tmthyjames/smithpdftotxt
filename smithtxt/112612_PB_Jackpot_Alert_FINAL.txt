THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS FOR BIGGEST

POWERBALL® JACKPOT IN HISTORY
Wednesday's $425 million jackpot has a cash value of $278.3 million

(AUSTIN) ­ In just two days, Texans will have the opportunity to win the second-largest lottery jackpot in world history. Wednesday night's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $425 million, making it the largest Powerball jackpot ever, and second among jackpots for all other lottery games. Only the $656 million Mega Millions® jackpot from March of this year was larger. Lottery players have until 9 p.m. Central time on Wednesday to purchase tickets. "Texas has had numerous Powerball second-tier winners of $1 million and $2 million, but we have never had a Powerball jackpot winner," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. "Since everything is bigger in Texas, we hope that it will be a Texan that will win this enormous jackpot." FACTS ABOUT THIS JACKPOT:     Largest jackpot in Powerball history. The second-highest cash value option jackpot in world lottery history ($278.3 million). Second-largest jackpot for any lottery game in world history (estimated $425 million). If no one wins on Wednesday, it could become the largest jackpot in world history, eclipsing the March 2012 Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million. Bigger jackpots, bigger sales "Powerball sales in Texas are showing a dramatic increase. Sales for yesterday alone were up 300 percent from the previous Sunday," said Grief. "Whenever we have these historic jackpots we see a tremendous increase in sales, which means more revenue for public education in Texas." (more)
