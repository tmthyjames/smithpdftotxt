SOARING SALES SPUR POWERBALL® JACKPOT TO RECORD $500 MILLION
Texas Lottery will live-Tweet drawing results as they come in from across the country

(AUSTIN) ­ Sky-high sales in Texas and across the nation have catapulted Wednesday night's record Powerball® jackpot to an estimated $500 million, with a cash value of $327 million. This is the largest Powerball jackpot ever and the second largest jackpot in history for any lottery game. Wednesday's drawing also offers players the chance to become millionaires even without matching all of the numbers. "Powerball sales in Texas are phenomenal. Sales for yesterday alone were nearly $3.2 million, which is a 577 percent increase from last Monday," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. "Texas is long overdue for a Powerball jackpot winner and we hope a Texan claims tomorrow night's jackpot." The winner of Wednesday's jackpot will not be the only Powerball prize winner. The game offers players the chance to become millionaires even without matching all of the numbers. In 2012 alone, Texas has had 16 Powerball second-tier winners of $1 million and $2 million, including five sold in November. Lottery players have until 9 p.m. Central time on Wednesday to purchase tickets for the drawing, which will be held at 9:59 Central time. Texas Lottery officials will live-Tweet drawing results as they come in from across the country. Powerball players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 59, plus the Powerball number from a field of 35. The second-tier prize, awarded for matching all five numbers, but not the Powerball number is $1 million. Players can increase their second-tier prize to $2 million if they purchase the $1 add-on feature Power Play® with their ticket. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 32.
