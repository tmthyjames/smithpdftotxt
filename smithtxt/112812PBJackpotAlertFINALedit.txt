"Texas has never had a Powerball jackpot winner and we are hoping for a big win tonight," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We wish our players good luck and remind them that it only takes one ticket to win." The winner of Wednesday's jackpot will not be the only Powerball prize winner. The game offers players the chance to become millionaires even without matching all of the numbers. In 2012 alone, Texas has had 16 Powerball second-tier winners of $1 million and $2 million, including five sold in November. Powerball players win the jackpot by correctly matching five numbers from a field of 59, plus the Powerball number from a field of 35. The second-tier prize, awarded for matching all five numbers, but not the Powerball number is $1 million. Players can increase their second-tier prize to $2 million if they purchase the $1 Power Play® with their ticket. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510, and overall odds of winning any prize are one in 32.
