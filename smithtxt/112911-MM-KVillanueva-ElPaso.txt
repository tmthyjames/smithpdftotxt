EL PASO RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION MEGA

MILLIONS® PRIZE FROM NOVEMBER 1 DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Katherine Villanueva of El Paso came forward yesterday to claim a $1 million prize from the Mega Millions® drawing held November 1. Villanueva's ticket matched all five numbers (39­31­46­40­27) but not the Mega Ball (36). This qualified her for the second-tier prize worth $250,000, but because she selected the Megaplier® option, the prize was automatically increased to $1 million. The 7-Eleven #607 located at 3525 N. Yarbrough Drive in El Paso sold the winning ticket. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $64 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $31 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $27 million.
