SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT FIRST WINNER TO CLAIM $1 MILLION PRIZE FROM LAST NIGHT'S DRAWING
Texas Lottery® awaits winners from Dallas, Houston and Humble
(AUSTIN) ­ The first of the $1 million winners from last night's record Powerball® drawing has claimed his prize. Ruben Briones of San Antonio was one of four lucky Texans matching five numbers (5­16­22­23­29) but not the Powerball (6) to win $1 million each. "Only one set of numbers were chosen on this lucky Powerball ticket, which proves once again that it only takes $2 to win big in this game," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery®. "We always encourage Texas Lottery players to enjoy these games responsibly, and evidently, Mr. Briones did and it paid off." Briones, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his ticket at the Frio City Food Mart, located at 707 Frio City Road in San Antonio. Texas was one of the top five selling states for last night's drawing, and the city of San Antonio alone accounted for more than $4 million in sales. During yesterday's peak selling period between 6:00 p.m. and 6:59 p.m., the Texas Lottery's sales per minute totaled $74,880. This surpasses Texas' highest hourly sales per minute rate of $70,839 for the March 30, 2012, Mega Millions® drawing.
