RONALD PUCEK, SR., OF MOUNTAIN HOME WINS $1 MILLION FROM TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYING MEGA MILLIONS® GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Ronald Pucek, Sr., of Mountain Home this week collected a prize of $1 million that he won playing Mega Millions® on Tuesday, November 21. "I've got 27 grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, a ton of brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews, and I'm going to share with everybody," Pucek said as he received his prize at Lottery headquarters in Austin. The ticket Pucek purchased correctly matched five of the six numbers drawn, which provides a prize of $250,000. The Megaplier® number that was drawn was four, which allows the player who purchased the feature to multiply the prize by that number. In Pucek's case, that turned the prize into $1 million. The numbers drawn were 7-13-20-42-47, and the Mega Ball was 9. "This is the time of year when `sharing' is the watchword among all families, and Mr. Pucek certainly has taken that to heart," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "By spending an additional dollar, Mr. Pucek was able to multiply a $250,000 prize into $1 million, which has allowed him to be even more generous with his family. The Lottery is pleased to have been able to help with that." Pucek purchased the ticket at Segovia's Truck Stop and Restaurant, I-10, exit 465, in Junction.
