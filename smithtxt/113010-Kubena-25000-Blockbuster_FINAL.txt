EAST BERNARD RESIDENT WINS $25,000 PLAYING $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­ Sharon Kubena has a system for buying Texas Lottery® scratch-offs that involves the number of the ticket as it sits in the display. That system, picking a ticket with a number between 11 and 18, helped her win $25,000 in $500,000,000 Blockbuster.

"Every time I buy a scratch-off, that's the first thing I ask the clerk," she said. "There's just something about the numbers between 11 and 18 that is lucky for me. I picked this ticket because it was number 11 on the roll, which is the date my son was born. Using this process, I've won other prizes, $100, $200 and even $500, but never anything close to this." Kubena scratched the ticket in piecemeal fashion in her car, thinking at first that she had won $20 and then $25. "When I saw the rest of the prize amount, I just about collapsed, I mean I got weak. I started my day quietly, taking my granddaughter to school and then stopping at Food Town to buy a gallon of milk and to get a ticket. Getting a prize like this is not something I expected at all."

"$500,000,000 Blockbuster was issued in May of 2009, and it continues to provide the spectacular prizes that have made this one of our most successful games ever," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "With four prizes of $2.5 million, 16 prizes of $1 million and 120 prizes of $25,000 remaining, as well as many more at the $10,000 level and below, it's no wonder this game remains a popular choice among our players."

Kubena called the prize "a gift," and said she will spend her winnings on her family. "This has been a tough year for my family," she said. "With this money I can help out my sister and even splurge on my husband, who will get new golf clubs from Santa at Christmas. I feel very blessed to be able to do this for my family." (more)
