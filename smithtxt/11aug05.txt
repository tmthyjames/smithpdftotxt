Goliad Monthly Bonus Player Starts The Month Off Right With $20,000 Win

Angelica Garcia of Goliad collected a $20,000 prize in the Texas Lottery Monthly Bonus scratch-off game.

(Austin, August 5) - While many Texans are happy just to beat the August heat, Angelica Garcia of Goliad beat the odds this week and collected a $20,000 prize in the Texas Lottery® Monthly Bonus scratch-off game. "It was my day off and I bought a ticket from the machine where I work," said Garcia. "I scratched the ticket in my car and completely flipped out. I had to get my mom and dad both to look at it to make sure I wasn't seeing things!" Garcia's eyesight was fine, and now she plans to use her winnings to pay off some bills and save a portion for her college tuition. "Congratulations to Ms. Garcia on her big win and on her plans to further her education," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery. "That's especially appropriate

considering that a portion of every dollar spent on Texas Lottery products helps support Texas education." The winning ticket was purchased at Super S Foods, located at 400 W. Pearl in Goliad. In addition to the second tier prize of $20,000, the $5 Monthly Bonus game also offers a top prize of $10,000 a month for 20 years, and other cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $2,000.
