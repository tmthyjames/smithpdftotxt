Texas Lottery® Transfers To Foundation School Fund Top $7 Billion
(Austin, February 2) - The Texas Lottery Commission announced today that total transfers to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas, have topped $7 billion. As of February 2, 2005, the exact amount transferred to the fund is $7,012,935,039. "This is another significant landmark in the history of the Texas Lottery," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The Games of Texas have created millions of winners in our more-than-12-year history, but with approximately 30 cents of every dollar spent on Texas Lottery products transferred to the Foundation School Fund, the biggest winner of all is public education in Texas." The Foundation School Fund, administered by the Texas Education Agency, assists public education in Texas at a local level by contributing to teacher salaries, administration and educational resources. Prior to 1997, proceeds from the Texas Lottery® were allocated to the state's General Revenue Fund. Since the first Texas Lottery ticket was sold in May 1992, revenue generated for the state of Texas through Texas Lottery sales total more than $12 billion.
