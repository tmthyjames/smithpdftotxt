(Austin, June 3) - Juanita Ontiveros of Alice collected the top cash prize in Mustang Money, $20,000, at the Texas Lottery Corpus Christi Claim Center this week. "I couldn't believe that I'd won this prize," Ontiveros said. "But I think the clerk at the store was more excited than I was." "Mustang Money shot out of the gate three weeks ago and has been one of our topselling instant tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "In fact, the game has had nearly $6 million in sales and been in our top 10 since it was issued." Ontiveros says she knows exactly what she's going to do with her prize. "I've got some bills to catch up on." While the $3-Mustang Money provided Ontiveros with a top prize, she usually plays

something else. "My regular game is Weekly Grand," she said. "The most I've ever won is $300, so winning this other prize was really hard to believe." Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $106 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million.
