It's No 'Mystery' Which Texas Lottery® Scratch Game Is Arlington Man's Favorite

Ronald Rimmer of Arlington collected the fifth top cash prize, $50,000, for the Texas Lottery Mystery Money scratch-off game.

(Austin, March 15) - Some Texas Lottery® scratch games can become real favorites of players. Ronald Rimmer of Arlington is no exception and says he may have to try his hand again at his new favorite - the Mystery Money scratch-off game. Rimmer scratched his way to the $50,000 top prize yesterday afternoon. "I didn't even want to buy the Mystery Money ticket at first, and bought a Money Carlo ticket instead. I ended up winning $5 on that one, so I let the clerk talk me into the Mystery Money ticket," Rimmer explained. "When I started scratching and seeing the symbols match, I wasn't sure how much I had won. I asked the clerk to check."

Rimmer said he called his wife immediately to tell her the good news. "We talked about what we wanted to do with the money on the way to the claim center in Fort Worth. We may pay off my wife's car and some bills, or just put it in the bank and think about it for a little while," he said. "We're definitely going on vacation, though, in May." "There's no mystery why our players like the Texas Lottery scratch games so much," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "As of today, there are 72 different scratch-off games available at retailer locations at a variety of price points, offering prizes up into the millions of dollars." Rimmer purchased his ticket at the M P Quick Mart, at 3601 W. Pioneer Parkway in Pantego. "The next time a retailer tries to sell you a scratch game, take it," advised Rimmer.
