Austin Cash Five® Player Floored By $29,214 Win
(Austin, September 2) - Longtime Austinite Shelley Bueche is devoted to her dogs and the Texas Lottery® Cash Five® game, but over the years, her dogs have pretty much ruined her carpet and her Cash Five numbers have never come in. But as we now leave the dog days of summer, she can stop pining away about her carpet, and spruce up her home with some new hardwood floors, because all of her Cash Five numbers matched in the August 31 drawing. She won $29,214! "I've been playing the exact same numbers forever, but this is the first time I've ever won anything in Cash Five," said Bueche. "Replacing my carpet may not sound too exciting, but the dogs have definitely made it necessary." In addition to the new flooring, Bueche said she and her husband also plan to use her winnings for a cruise in the near future. Bueche cashed in her ticket at the Austin Claim Center and, just in case this is the beginning of a trend, she bought a few more tickets for the next Cash Five drawing. "Ms. Bueche's big win was a long time coming, but it sounds like it was worth the wait," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery. "And with six Cash Five drawings a week, she might be a winner again sooner than she thinks!" Bueche purchased her ticket at the Sac-N-Pac #406 located at 1525 Highway 71 West in Cedar Creek.
