PEARLAND RESIDENT CLAIMS $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Jeffry R. Anthony of Pearland claimed a Mega Millions second-tier prize worth $1 million. The ticket was purchased at the Randall's #4612 C located at 2850 FM 518 #1 in Pearland for the Nov. 4 drawing. The claimant requested minimal publicity.

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
