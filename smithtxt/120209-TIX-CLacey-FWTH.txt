FORT WORTH RESIDENT READY TO SIT DOWN FOR 2010 SEASON GAMES AT COWBOYS STADIUM
(Austin) ­ Carrie Lacey of Fort Worth is such a die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan that she and her husband have been buying "Party Pass" tickets that allow them to stand in either end-zone just so they can support their favorite team.

"Now I get to sit down, and I can hardly believe it," Lacey said. "Next year is going to be a great season for the Cowboys, too. I already know it because I keep up with these things." Lacey won season tickets to the Dallas Cowboys home games in 2010 in a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing. When Lacey got the call from a Lottery official, she thought to herself that it was a holiday scam.

"I was ready to hear the man on the phone ask me for money or my social security number, but he never did," she said. "Then he gave me directions to the Fort Worth Claim Center, and I knew it was true. I started shaking, and then I moved on to screaming. I called my husband who got just as excited as I got. This is one of the best things that has ever happened to us."

The words, "Dallas Cowboys" made her buy the ticket, she said. "I remembered hearing on the news to sign the ticket right after buying it. Since the ticket didn't win a money prize, I sent it in and didn't give it a second thought. You can imagine my surprise when I got the call. It was just one ticket!"

What makes this extra special for Lacey and her husband is that in 2011, the Super Bowl will be held in the Dallas Cowboys' new stadium in Arlington. (more)

"Before I got the call from the Lottery, I had already signed up as a volunteer to work during the 2011 Super Bowl," she said. "We're just a 25-minute drive from the stadium."

Before then, however, Lacey said she and her husband will be at all the home games.

"We plan to attend with the same friends who go with us now who also have `Party Passes,'" she said. "I'm sure we'll trade out our tickets with them at half-time so they can sit in the seats at least during one half and we'll stand in the end zone."

"How great is this? Not only did Ms. Lacey win season tickets, she's going to share with her `Party Pass' pals so they can also experience the fun of sitting between the 30-yard lines at a home game," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief.

The next Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing will be held December 15. Six top prizes of $100,000 each remain unclaimed, and overall odds of winning any cash prize are one in 3.85, including break-even prizes. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $69 million.
