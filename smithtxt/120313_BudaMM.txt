TEXAN CLAIMS FIRST $5 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® MEGAPLIER® PRIZE
$257 million Mega Millions jackpot still up for grabs tonight, highest jackpot this year (AUSTIN) ­ The first $5 million second-tier Mega Millions® prize was awarded today to Pedro Luna of Buda. Luna, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his winning ticket at the Sac-N-Pac #402 located at 204 FM 2001 in Buda. As part of a recent Texas Lottery promotion, Pedro Luna of Buda received a free Quick Pick Mega Millions ticket with the Megaplier® option added. The ticket matched all of the numbers drawn (27 ­ 44 ­ 59 ­ 74 ­ 75) but not the Mega Ball number (3). Normally this would qualify him for a $1 million prize. However, the Megaplier number five was selected, multiplying his non-jackpot winnings and making his ticket the first ever to win a $5 million Mega Millions second-tier prize. Tonight, Texas Lottery® players have the chance to try for an estimated $257 million Mega Millions jackpot. If no one matches all of the numbers drawn tonight, Friday's jackpot could be worth an estimated $291 million. That would be the highest Mega Millions jackpot since the record-setting $656 million jackpot from March 30, 2012.
