EL PASO THREESOME SHARES $225,000 TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT PRIZE FROM NOVEMBER 13 DRAW
(AUSTIN) ­Three El Paso-area co-workers will each take a third of the November 13 $225,000 Texas Two Step® jackpot. The ticket in which Julia Salazar has a share was bought at the Circle K #0213, 11096 Pebble Hills in El Paso, using some special numbers that matched the numbers drawn that night. "I used the birthdays and ages of my children and husband, and even mine, for the ticket we were going to buy," Salazar said. "Albert Gutierrez is another member of our pool and he kept the ticket after he bought it at the Circle K using the numbers I'd given him." Salazar and Gutierrez are joined by Salazar's cousin, Jessica Morales, in the ticket-buying threesome. All are co-workers at Southwest Freight Lines, an El Paso trucking company. "Albert had the ticket and knew that our numbers had matched the winning numbers," Salazar said. "But Friday is the busiest day of the week at the office, especially where we work, which is in the accounting department. We have to make payroll and make sure that our vendors are paid, too, so we didn't have time to talk about the ticket." It wasn't until Saturday that Salazar and her cousin got the news from Gutierrez. The trio met in the parking lot of another Circle K store close to where they all happened to be that morning.

"When he told us, my cousin and I started jumping up and down," she said. "We were laughing and crying and even screaming, all at the same time because we were so happy." It wasn't long before everybody back at the office knew. "We told everybody what had happened and they couldn't believe it," she said. "But they were so happy for us that they bought us a cake so we could all celebrate." As soon as they can get coordinated, the three players and their families will all get together for a celebratory dinner at an El Paso restaurant. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, which is $2,250. Tomorrow night's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $146 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $13 million.
