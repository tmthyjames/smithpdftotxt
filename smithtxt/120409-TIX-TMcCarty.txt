HOUSTON WOMAN WINS TICKETS TO DALLAS COWBOYS 2010 SEASON IN 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ It takes some major multitasking talent to finesse driving safely while answering a phone call with a whopping piece of news from the Texas Lottery® and having a two-year-old also trying to get your attention at the same time.

Such were the circumstances when Talitha McCarty of Houston learned she had won a pair of Dallas Cowboys 2010 season tickets in a Texas Lottery Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing.

"I was very excited to speak with the man from the Texas Lottery, and I still am," she said. "But I really had to keep my composure while I was trying to keep my two-year-old son quiet."

McCarty told her mother, her boyfriend and her co-workers, in that order, about her prize. They were excited for her and even `volunteered' to go to the games for her that she couldn't attend.

"I'm already looking forward to next July when the pre-season starts," she said. "I bought only one Dallas Cowboys ticket because the store didn't have some of the scratch-off tickets I regularly buy, but I like playing all of them, the scratch-offs and the online. I won $1,000 on a scratch-off recently and $500 on Pick 3 last year. They call me `Lucky' at work because I win all the time."
