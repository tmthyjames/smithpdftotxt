WEEKLY HALF GRAND TOP PRIZE CLAIMED BY MESQUITE RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Mesquite resident Shilithia Roberson is a fan of Texas Lottery® scratch-offs and plays them regularly. On a recent visit to a 7-Eleven, her interest in the games led her to scratch her way to a top prize in the Weekly Half Grand game. That is $500 per week for 20 years, totaling $520,000. "Weekly Grand is one of our oldest and most popular scratch-offs, so it only made sense to create a whole suite of games based on that game," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "Our players seem to agree that all of the games in the suite offer exciting ways to `make it grand.'" The $1 Weekly Half Grand scratch-off game was introduced in September and has already created two half-millionaires. Two more top prizes and millions of prizes from $1 to $500 currently remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any Weekly Half Grand prize are one in 4.58, including break-even prizes. Roberson says there is no special secret to winning, "Just try your luck." Roberson tried her luck at the 7-Eleven Convenience Store #35648 A at 3020 N. Hampton Road in Dallas.
