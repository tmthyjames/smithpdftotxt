SCRATCH-OFF TICKET AWARDS SAN ANTONIO MAN $30,000-WORTH OF HOLIDAY CHEER
(AUSTIN) ­ Jason Gonzales was optimistic walking into the SK Food Mart, located at 2407 Ackerman Road in San Antonio. Having won as much as $500 on Texas Lottery® scratch-off tickets in the past, he wanted to gain a quick $100 or so to boost his Christmas spending money. After asking the clerk at the counter about the latest $2 instant tickets, he chose the holiday-themed Candy Cane Cash. The San Antonio resident says he likes to play the newest scratch-offs for one simple reason ­ more prizes remain unclaimed. His strategy worked, but he won more than a small stocking stuffer. The winning ticket revealed a top prize of $30,000. "I won on the second ticket I scratched," he said. "I just couldn't believe it." He got a second opinion right away. "My dad was sitting next to me. We both read over the rules to be sure. Then I went back to the store to check it," he explained. Sure enough, his numbers matched, and the windfall has Gonzales making some practical plans. "I'm going to pay off some bills and maybe save a little for stuff around the house," he said. "Maybe I'll use some for Christmas gifts. It's not good to be too greedy."

The Texas Lottery Commission looks to seasonal tickets to benefit Texas education. "With holiday-themed scratch-offs ranging from the $1 Stocking Stuffer to a $20 ticket called $1 Million Holiday Winnings, the Texas Lottery Commission seeks to keep games fresh during this season with the goal of continuing to earn money for the Foundation School Fund," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. According to Gonzales, he'll keep scratching tickets because he knows how to maintain his good luck. He believes, "If you do good things, good things will happen." Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $96 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million.
