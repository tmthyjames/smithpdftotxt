$1 MILLION COMES AT RIGHT TIME FOR LONGVIEW WOMAN
(AUSTIN) ­ After a hard year, winning the million-dollar top prize with a $1 Million Extravaganza instant ticket from the Texas Lottery® makes the Christmas season significantly merrier for one Longview family. Although mother Jamie Niehaus requested minimal publicity, she did share one bit of wisdom. During this holiday season and all year round, "Put family first." The Scotties-Longview, located at 401 W Hawkins Parkway in Longview, is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. Only one top prize remains in this $20 scratch-off game. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $96 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million.
