    TEXAS LOTTERY® REMINDS PLAYERS AGAINST GIVING LOTTERY TICKETS TO MINORS AS HOLIDAY GIFTS
(Austin) ­ The holiday season is now in full swing, and the Texas Lottery® in conjunction with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and McGill University, reminds players not to purchase lottery tickets as gifts for children and adolescents. Responding to concerns about adolescent problem gambling, NCPG annually spearheads a national campaign to raise awareness about the effects of giving lottery products to minors. Lotteries, state agencies and advocacy groups throughout the country collaborate to provide information to the public through news and video releases, as well as public service announcements issued via satellite. "As colorful as they are, Texas Lottery holiday tickets with their festive artwork and holiday themes are designed with adults in mind, not children and adolescents," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "You must be at least 18 years old to purchase a Texas Lottery ticket. We are once again pleased to add our voice to the call of the National Council on Problem Gambling to be responsible in gift-giving to children this holiday season." The Texas Lottery will support the national campaign by releasing a public service announcement that will also be available on the official agency Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. The following Web sites offer additional information about adolescent gambling issues and resources for those who are concerned that they or someone they know may have a gambling problem.
