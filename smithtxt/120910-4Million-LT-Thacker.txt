    PASADENA RESIDENT WINS $4 MILLION LOTTO

TEXAS® JACKPOT IN LAST SATURDAY'S DRAWING
(Austin) ­Michael Thacker of Pasadena has claimed the $4 million jackpot from last Saturday's Lotto Texas® drawing. Thacker purchased five Quick Pick tickets, each with the Cash Value Option (CVO). As a result, on the ticket that matched the numbers drawn, he won a prize of $2,671,041.60, before taxes. The numbers in last Saturday's drawing were 14-9-6-27-5-51. Before coming to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin, he told his bosses what was going on. "I didn't call in and give notice," Thacker said. "I called in `retired.'" There won't be much splurging at the Thacker household. A new car for Mrs. Thacker, a refinish job on the pool for Thacker himself and a wrought-iron gate for the house are the only personal items the winner is buying. The rest is for retirement and helping family members. "I want to congratulate Mr. Thacker on his Lotto Texas win and his retirement," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's great to hear winners tell us they plan to use their prize to help family members and retire a little early." Thacker purchased the ticket at The Express, 11302 Space Center Boulevard, Suite A, in Houston. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $40,000, 1 percent of the advertised jackpot for selling this ticket.
