SAN ANTONIO WOMAN NEW TO TEXAS LOTTERY® TICKETS WINS $100,000 PLAYING WINTER BUCKS SCRATCH-OFF
(Austin) ­ If there is such a thing as "beginner's luck," then Nancy Tucker might have it. The San Antonio resident did not start buying Texas Lottery® tickets until two weeks ago and this week won the top prize of $100,000 in Winter Bucks. "I have seen my friends win $250 one day and then win another $250 a few days later, so I thought I might try my luck, too," Tucker said. "When I scratched the ticket and saw the $100,000, I put it up to the light, I put it down, I stretched out my arm with the ticket in my hand to look at it that way because I couldn't believe it. For a minute, I really thought I was seeing things." The "thing" was indeed $100,000, the top prize in the $10 holiday game. Tucker bought the ticket at the HEB Food Store #613, located at 8219 Marbach Road in San Antonio. "Once I saw that was real, it hit me that I could help my family, especially now that it's the holiday time of the year," Tucker said. "I'm taking my daughter shopping and we're going to buy a Christmas tree this week. I'll get a new car for myself later and save the rest for a rainy day." "Winter Bucks is one of the offerings in our holiday suite of games, all of which have many wonderful prizes for our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's also gratifying to learn that Ms. Tucker will help her family first with her winnings before doing anything else. This game began on November 1, and already four of the six top prizes of $100,000 have been claimed." (more)
