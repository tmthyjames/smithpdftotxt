JACKPOT ALERT
TEXAS LOTTERY® FANS PLAYING FOR BIG JACKPOTS THIS WEEK
$344 million Mega Millions® and $122 Powerball® jackpots up for grabs (AUSTIN) ­Texas Lottery® players will get the chance to play for an estimated $344 million Mega Millions® prize Tuesday evening, and then they'll get a shot at an estimated $122 million Powerball® prize the very next day. Players who choose the Mega Millions add-on feature Megaplier® for just $1 more per play can even multiply their non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, or 5 times. That means even ticket holders who don't match all of the numbers can win up to $5 million. The Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots are the largest in the country this week, but Wednesday's Lotto Texas® also snuck into the top ten nationwide with an estimated $7 million jackpot.
