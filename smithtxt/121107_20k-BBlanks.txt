SAN ANTONIO WOMAN WINS $20,000 PRIZE PLAYING NEW $50 SCRATCH-OFF
(AUSTIN) ­ Just over seven months after producing a groundbreaking $50 scratch-off ticket, the Texas Lottery® launched a second $50 instant ticket, the $130 Million Payout Bonanza. Although she doesn't normally spend much on scratch-offs, Betty J. Blanks of San Antonio decided to buy the newest $50 scratch-off as a treat for herself. "It was on a whim," said Blanks. "I had extra cash and wanted to splurge a little." She won 10 prizes of $2,000 each on the ticket for a total of $20,000, the largest prize awarded so far from the $130 Million Payout Bonanza game. The three prizes of $3 million and six prizes of $1 million each remain unclaimed. "I drove home with the dome light on in the car to keep an eye on that ticket," she said. When she got home, she showed her husband, but he was unimpressed. Not a lottery player himself, he thought she must be mistaken. He asked, "Are you sure?" Blanks replied, "It's the real deal." On pins and needles waiting to claim the prize, she says her nerves kept her from even sharing the news with her mother. "I'm overjoyed, just overwhelmed," said Blanks.

She knows exactly what she wants to do with the money, too. Her two children will both receive cars for Christmas. "Both $50 tickets are exciting additions to our game line-up," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "However, as always, we caution our customer to take a cue from Mrs. Blanks and play responsibly." The winning ticket came from the Carry On store located at 4447 DeZavala in San Antonio. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $115 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
