GAS PUMP BOREDOM PAYS OFF FOR DALLAS-AREA RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ While waiting impatiently for his gas tank to fill yesterday evening, Matthew Brown of Carrollton decided to buy a scratchoff ticket to help pass the time. He bought only a single ticket, but that ticket revealed the final $77,000 prize from the Spicy Hot 7's game. Not surprised, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry said, "We continue to remind our players that it takes only one ticket to win, and Mr. Brown's story shows how a little entertainment can pay off in a big way." Without wasting any time, Brown brought the ticket to the Dallas Claim Center first thing in the morning. "You can't wait to come in with something like that burning a hole in your pocket," he said. Despite winning as much as $30 in the past, Brown had trouble convincing his family that he'd won the top prize. However, he understands their skepticism. "You think someone's telling a joke or that they're talking about someone else who won or something," he said. "You never think it will happen so close to you." It's no joke. Brown plans to use the extra cash for Christmas presents and possibly even a special gift for himself.

"I'm not in school right now because of some financial problems, but this could help with that," he explained. The top-prize winning ticket worth $77,000 was purchased at the Marsh Lane Texaco located at 2525 E Rosemeade Parkway in Carrollton. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $115 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
