HOUSTON-AREA TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER WINS FOOTBALL TRIP IN SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ In the week before Christmas, it will likely be visions of Houston Texans star players, not sugar plums, dancing in the head of one Houston-area Texas Lottery® player. Rebecca Drapak of Kingwood won an exclusive trip to watch some football in a recent second-chance drawing for the Houston Texans scratch-off game. "I was shocked," said Drapak. "I plan to go to the Texans game in style!" The Houston Texans "Private Away Game Trip ­ Owner for a Day" prize package from the November 17 drawing went to Drapak. She and a guest will receive airfare and hotel accommodations for a 2012 Houston Texans away game, police escort to the stadium, suite tickets, pregame sideline passes and a Texans "Ownership Collection" gift bag. "This is our third year to offer the Houston Texans scratch-off game, and it remains a fan favorite," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Not only can you win up to $100,000 instantly, but you can also enter your non-winning tickets in the second-chance drawings for exciting prizes just like Ms. Drapak." Players can enter their non-winning tickets online at www.txlottery.org/luckzone for a second chance to win in the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans or ElvisTM scratch-off games, and Drapak recommends it. "Go ahead and send in the second-chance entries." (more)
