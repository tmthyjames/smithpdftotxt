Will Friday the 13TH Be a Lucky Day For a Texas Lottery® Player?
Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is now $425 million!
(AUSTIN) ­Texas Lottery® players can test their Friday the 13th luck with the drawing for tonight's estimated $425 million Mega Millions® jackpot prize. This is the second largest Mega Millions jackpot on record and the fifth largest jackpot for any U.S. lottery game. The cash value of the record jackpot is $228.2 million.

To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.

On Dec. 3, Pedro Luna of Buda claimed a $5 million Mega Millions prize and on July 16, 2013, Texas' 10th Mega Millions jackpot prize winning ticket was sold at the Rosslyn Food Mart located at 9245 N. Houston Rosslyn Road in Houston. The Lucky Ones Partnership chose to collect the $13,221,900 cash value of the drawing's advertised $20 million jackpot.
