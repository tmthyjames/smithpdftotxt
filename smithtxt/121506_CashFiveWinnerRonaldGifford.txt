PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR CASH FIVE® PLAYER; WINS $15,041 USING HIS OWN NUMBERS IN DECEMBER 8 DRAW
(AUSTIN) ­ A plan for playing Texas Lottery® games made about five years ago has paid off. Ronald Gifford decided he would create a list of numbers he was going to use every time he wanted to buy Cash Five® or Texas Two Step® tickets, the online games he likes to play. "I went through the frequency charts on the Texas Lottery Web site and came up with my own list of numbers to play," Gifford said. "I've been playing them ever since and they have paid off." "Our Web site provides a wide range of information related to playing all of our games, and the pages with number frequency charts are among the most popular," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Mr. Gifford has certainly used our homepage to his advantage." In fact, it was on the Texas Lottery's Web site that Gifford discovered he had won a prize of $15,041 in last Friday night's Cash Five game. "I checked my numbers right before my wife and I went out to breakfast," he said. "I told her we were going to have more than enough money to pay for breakfast. Then, I showed her the ticket and we both just stood there shaking." Gifford took his family to dinner that night to celebrate the win. "My wife has told me that we're going on vacation soon," he said. "We're going back to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. This prize also comes in handy right now, right before Christmas."

Gifford won an additional $93 in the same drawing using four of the five numbers that were drawn. "I mostly play Cash Five and Texas Two Step," he said. "I cashed the ticket that gave me the $93 that same morning at the store where I'd bought the tickets." Gifford purchased the tickets at Texas Food, 1101 California Lane, in Arlington. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the top prize. That comes to $150.41. A second top-prize-winning ticket for the same drawing was sold in Bryan. The numbers drawn were 9-23-6-19-15. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $13 million.
