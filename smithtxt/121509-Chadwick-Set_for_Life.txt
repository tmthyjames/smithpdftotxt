WACO RESIDENT WINS $5 MILLION WITH SET FOR LIFE FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­Allen Lee Chadwick of Waco bought one Set For Life scratch-off ticket, thinking that it might bring him only a small prize. He didn't imagine it would bring him the top prize, one that he can use to help someone in his family who truly needs some assistance.

"My brother has had severe health problems with his vision as a result of diabetes during the last several years, and now I can help him with some of his bills," he said. "I also want to buy a small home for myself, nothing crazy like you see some winners do. The last thing I want to accomplish is restore to a bright blue a 1967 Pontiac Firebird muscle car that I own. I've wanted to do that for a long time."

Chadwick was at home when he decided he couldn't stand it anymore and scratched the $250,000 Bingo ticket he'd gotten earlier and kept in his pocket.

"I won $500, and that made me return to the store," he said. "I bought one Set For Life ticket and scratched only the first line in my car. I went back into the store to ask the clerk if the ticket really said what I thought it said. My heart was racing."

Chadwick said he got one hour of sleep that night, keeping one eye on the box where he stashed his ticket. He bought a small alarm clock so he could wake up with plenty of time to make the drive to Lottery headquarters in Austin.

"I thought I had set it correctly, but apparently not," he said. "That thing went off almost every hour, at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., and 3 a.m." (more)

(Texas Lottery Commission, News Release, continued) "At this time of the year, it is especially heartwarming to know that our winner will use his prize to help out his brother," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "The Set For Life game offers three top prizes of $250,000 per year for 20 years for a total prize of $5 million. After today's claim, one top prize remains unclaimed."

Chadwick bought the ticket at the LaSalle Food Mart, 1400 LaSalle Avenue, in Waco. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $118 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $20 million.
