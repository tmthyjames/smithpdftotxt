IN FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2008, CHARITABLE BINGO GROSS RECEIPTS REACH $514.8 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ During the first three quarters of 2008, non-profit organizations across Texas that conduct charitable bingo games reported gross receipts of $514,887,660. "Gross receipts from the first three quarters of this year reflect an increase of 3.15 percent compared to the same period in 2007 when gross receipts were $499.1 million," said Phil Sanderson, director of the charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "This increase in gross receipts is also mirrored in the 3.23 percent spike in total prizes paid out in 2007. Prizes in the first three quarters of 2007 were $372.5 million. This year, to date, the prizes stand at $384.5 million." Most of the 1,165 non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games to raise money for their charitable causes also sell pull-tabs. "This year during the first three quarters, the sale of pull-tabs brought in $229.5 million, compared to the $206.5 million in 2007," Sanderson said. "Pull tabs are also known as instant bingo." The financial information for charitable bingo is relayed to the agency at the end of each quarter by the charities that conduct bingo. The charitable bingo division of the Texas Lottery Commission compiles the information through the first half of the succeeding quarter. (more)
