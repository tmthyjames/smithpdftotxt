BRENHAM WOMAN OVERCOMES BAD LUCK, CLAIMS FIRST TOP PRIZE IN WEEKLY BONUS
(AUSTIN) ­ When her car refused to start Monday, Kris D. Davis of Brenham could have felt down on her luck. Instead, she got the car running, picked up the two Weekly Bonus tickets she'd just purchased, and turned her luck around. "Normally I scratch the tickets at home, but I decided to go ahead and scratch them while I was sitting there in the car," explained Davis. "I scratched the first ticket and got $1. Then I scratched the second ticket, and the number four matched. I thought I had won another dollar. Then I saw the prize, $500 a week for 20 years." Introduced in November, the Weekly Bonus game features more than $18.2 million in total prizes, with a top prize of $500 a week for 20 years, not to exceed $520,000. Davis uncovered the first of five top prizes in the new Texas Lottery® scratch-off. "I was so elated," she said. "I'm still excited." Right away, Davis started telling her friends and family about the win. According to Davis, "Everyone's asking me if I'll keep working. Yes, I'll continue to work. This is a blessing from God, but this is only temporary." Already thinking about the best use for the money, Davis wants to provide help to her mother, children and church.

"It is always encouraging to hear our winners mention their families and communities, but with the holidays approaching, Mrs. Davis's plans are especially heartwarming," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. Davis purchased her winning ticket at the Brenham Food Stop #2, located at 1312 Prairie Lea St. in Brenham. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
