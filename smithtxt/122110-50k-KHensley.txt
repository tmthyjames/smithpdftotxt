TOP-PRIZE WIN TO PROVIDE A HAPPY HOLIDAY AND HONEYMOON TRIP FOR LUFKIN COUPLE
(AUSTIN) ­ It's shaping up to be a very happy holiday for one Lufkin couple. Klint Hensley and his wife married last fall, but they decided to put off their honeymoon for a few months to save some money. Now, they will be able to treat themselves to a special trip thanks to a $50,000 top prize in the Ruby Red 5's Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. "We haven't decided where we'll go yet. We were too excited to even think about it," explained Hensley. "It's just awesome." Hensley won on one of two tickets he purchased at the Speedway, 7183 U.S. Highway 59 North in Goodrich. He often buys tickets there when he travels to Houston because they have a good selection of scratch-offs. "I like the $5 tickets, like Monthly Bonus, Big Money Bingo and now the Ruby Red 5's," said Hensley. "I've won, nothing like this, but I've won $1,000. I win $200 all the time." Hensley says he plans to keep winning. "I'm so thankful. I always played the lottery, and I will continue to play." "Mr. Hensley must be a lucky man. Not only did he get married recently, but he also won enough money to make his honeymoon a truly memorable event," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. (more)
