$30 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT PRIZE CLAIMED TODAY BY SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Michael Militana is a transplanted Texan, having come over from Florida, but born in New York state. When he first came to Texas four years ago, he quickly fell in love with the Lone Star state, especially the first city he visited, San Antonio. Now that he's won the December 8 Lotto Texas® jackpot prize advertised at $30 million, his warm feelings for Texas have grown exponentially. The Cash Value Option amount of the prize is $19,468,786.75, before taxes. "I love Texas," Militana exclaimed. "What else can I say, especially after this, I love it here." The new winner has been playing Lotto Texas every week since he arrived in state. He was born in Westchester County, New York, and has also lived in Florida. "My wife told me I was wasting my money on the lottery tickets," he said. "She has, however, changed her mind about that." Militana has worked for a computer company in the San Antonio area. He says he plans to share his winnings with family members and donate to charities that benefit animals, including animal shelters.

"Mr. Militana, like many of our winners knows how he plans to use his winnings, putting family first and then helping a worthy cause, the charities and groups that care for abandoned and abused animals," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "The prize claimed today was the largest among the five million-dollar-plus prizes and the one $750,000 prize claimants picked up at Lottery headquarters this week. In fact, two of those winners were from the San Antonio-area, two from Beaumont, a fifth from Houston, and the sixth winner was from San Marcos." He and his wife plan to travel to Italy next year, he told Lottery officials. They also plan to travel to other parts of Europe in the coming years. Militana purchased his ticket at the Phillips Express, 13300 Nacogdoches Road in San Antonio. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $308,747.39 for selling this ticket. The new winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million.
