$250,000 MEGA MILLIONS® WINNER WANTS TO KEEP PLAYING, WINNING
(AUSTIN) ­Timothy Dodd of Texarkana has been a regular Texas Lottery® player for the last 10 years. He recently claimed a Mega Millions® second-tier prize worth $250,000, and he plans to keep playing and, hopefully, winning. Dodd matched all five numbers (15 ­ 16 ­ 27 ­ 40 ­ 52), but not the Mega Ball (16), for the December 24 drawing. No one won the grand/jackpot prize, and the estimated grand/jackpot prize for tonight's drawing is $200 million. This Quick Pick ticket was purchased at the Stateline Citgo, 5023 N. Stateline Ave. in Texarkana. "The Stateline Citgo has been busy this year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "They've sold a number of winning tickets worth $1,000, and in March they sold a Daily 4 ticket which matched the numbers drawn for a $25,000 prize. Now, they can boast a $250,000 winner in Mega Millions with Mr. Dodd's prize." Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
