DALLAS COWBOYS FAN FROM HELOTES TO SHARE SEASON TICKETS WITH CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY
(AUSTIN) ­ If at first you don't succeed, send in your non-winning Dallas Cowboys tickets for the second-chance drawing. That's what Jesse Montez of Helotes did, and he won a pair of tickets between the 30-yard lines for next season's Cowboys home games. Montez received a phone call from a Texas Lottery® representative informing him of the win and called it "one of the most exciting days of my life." He usually plays two tickets at a time, and if he doesn't win instantly, he enters the second-chance drawings which feature a variety of prizes, including gift cards, autographed jerseys, exclusive trips and, of course, season tickets. He wants to take his closest friends and family to the games. "We are proud to work with the Dallas Cowboys to provide a fun game with multiple ways for our players to win," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mr. Montez and his guests will surely enjoy next season's games in Cowboys Stadium." Dallas Cowboys players can win up to $250,000 instantly. Overall odds of winning any cash prize are one in 3.47, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can send in their non-winning tickets for the second-chance drawings. The next drawing is scheduled for January 11, 2011, and the deadline to enter is January 7. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $200 million. Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
