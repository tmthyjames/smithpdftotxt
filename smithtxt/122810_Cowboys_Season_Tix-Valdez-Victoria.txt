FOR VICTORIA RESIDENT, IT TURNED OUT TO BE A `BIGGER PRESENT' THAN HE THOUGHT WITH 2011 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS (Austin) ­ Rudy Valdez of Victoria was beside himself with joy Monday morning when he received a call from the Texas Lottery® informing him that he had won a Dallas Cowboys prize in a second-chance drawing. "I was so happy to find out I had won tickets to a game, at least, that's what I thought when I was talking to the man from the lottery," Valdez said. "When I got to the claim center, the staff there told me I had tickets to an entire season. That really made me happy, and my wife was superthrilled. This is a great way to start 2011. To celebrate, I'm having a big barbecue at my house this week." Valdez said he hoped he would win something, but never imagined it would really come true. "My brothers and I are already enjoying it because we're all Cowboy fans. It's a gift my family and I will always remember." "This is a great prize for anyone who is a fan of football in Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The prize provides for two tickets per home game next season, and those will be between the thirty-yard lines. For any fan of the Dallas Cowboys, this prize is a dream come-true." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $200 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
