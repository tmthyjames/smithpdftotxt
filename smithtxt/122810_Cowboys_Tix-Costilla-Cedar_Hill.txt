LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE FOR CEDAR HILL WOMAN WHO WINS 2011 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS AGAIN
(Austin) ­ Vanessa Costilla of Cedar Hill has been in this exact spot before, just two months and two second-chance drawings ago. As in October, she learned yesterday afternoon that she had once again won a prize in a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing: a pair of tickets to the 2011 Dallas Cowboys home games, the same prize she won in the October drawing. Costilla ran through a spectrum of emotions, from shock to disbelief and many shades of both in between, all of which her family members also felt, she said. "To say that we're all shocked in my family doesn't come close. Now more of my family members can go to the games next year and maybe we can sit near each other. If I can win this prize twice, I might win something else someday. You have to press your luck and keep on playing if you plan to win." "This is a noteworthy event, although not an improbable one," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "While players cannot win two prizes in the same second-chance drawing, they can enter all of our drawings and are eligible to win in each one. We're pleased for Ms. Costilla that this second win of the same prize will allow more members of her family to attend the home games of the Dallas Cowboys in 2011." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $200 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. More information about the Texas Lottery® is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
