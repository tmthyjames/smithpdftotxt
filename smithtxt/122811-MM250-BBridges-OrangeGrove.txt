ORANGE GROVE RESIDENT RECEIVED A $250,000 CHRISTMAS PRESENT WITH MEGA MILLIONS® WIN
(Austin) ­ When Brandon Bridges of Orange Grove stopped at a Speedy Stop Food Store in Portland, he didn't plan on buying a Mega Millions® ticket. Then he saw that the grand/jackpot prize was an advertised $152 million, and he decided to grab a Quick Pick. "I didn't even check my tickets at first. Then I looked it up on my computer, and the numbers were in order, just like my ticket," said Bridges. "I was excited and just kept rechecking the numbers." The ticket matched all five numbers (20 ­ 24 ­ 27 ­ 45 ­ 51) but not the Mega Ball (31) for the drawing held December 20. Bridges won the $250,000 second-tier prize, but it took a trip to the Texas Lottery® claim center in Corpus Christi to convince his wife. "She said I must have misread it. She believes now that we came to the claim center. We had to come to see if it was real." "We often hear from winners who have a hard time convincing their loved ones that they've won the lottery," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's true, though, that real Texans win real prizes playing the Games of Texas." The Speedy Stop Food Store #59, located at 1201 Wildcat Drive in Portland, sold Bridges the winning ticket. Tonight's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $8 million. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $12 million.
