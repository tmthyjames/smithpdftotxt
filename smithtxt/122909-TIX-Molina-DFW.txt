DALLAS WOMAN WINS DALLAS COWBOYS 2010 SEASON TICKETS IN TEXAS LOTTERY® 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Holding to the philosophy that "two chances are better than one," Andrea Molina of Dallas submitted her non-winning Dallas Cowboys tickets in the most recent Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing, and as sure as the Cowboys beat the Washington Redskins last Sunday, she won tickets to the Dallas Cowboys 2010 season.

Molina got the call from Texas Lottery officials on Monday and wasted no time in getting to the Lottery Claim Center in Dallas with just enough time to make it back home before her husband arrived from work so she could give him the news.

"The caller-ID said `Unknown,' so I didn't pick it up until the man from the Lottery identified himself and said why he was calling," Molina said. "I believed him right away. All I could think to myself was, `my hubby is going to love this,' because we're big fans of the Cowboys."

Indeed, Molina came to the Lottery Claim Center ready to claim her prize, proudly sporting a Dallas Cowboys jersey with the number `9' emblazoned on it. That number belongs to quarterback Tony Romo.

"Next year, it's going to be my husband and me at those games," she said. "If I'm tired or can't go for some reason, my brother will probably go with my husband. I'm not missing any games, if I can help it. This was a great Christmas present. Go Cowboys!" (more)

"There's no question about it, two chances certainly are better than one, especially in this case," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "For Ms. Molina and her husband, 2010 is going to be an exciting year, thanks to the second-chance drawing. Like she said, go Cowboys!"

Five of the 13 top cash prizes of $100,000 offered in the Dallas Cowboys game are still unclaimed. The last regularly-scheduled second-chance drawing occurred on December 15. Once the game closes, a final second-chance drawing will be held. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $26 million.
