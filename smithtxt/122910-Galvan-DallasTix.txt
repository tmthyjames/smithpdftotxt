  WINNER OF 2011 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS WILL TAKE DAUGHTER TO FIRST-EVER NFL FOOTBALL GAME
(Austin) ­ Lisa Galvan's daughter will learn first-hand in the fall of 2011 just how exciting a Dallas Cowboys football game can be when she attends her first-ever NFL game, thanks to the 2011 Dallas Cowboys season tickets her mother won in a Texas Lottery® second-chance drawing. "We're going to party with all the other Cowboy fans," Galvan said. "I told the man from the lottery who called me about this that winning this prize is awesome." Galvan, who is from Fort Worth, has been playing Texas Lottery games for three years. Her advice to other players is simple. "You have to keep trying." "Ms. Galvan's prize of 2011 Dallas Cowboys season tickets is one of 20 pairs of tickets awarded in the November Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Attending any of next year's home games in the new stadium that seats 80,000 and can expand to seat 100,000 will be unforgettable for our winner and her daughter." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $237 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
