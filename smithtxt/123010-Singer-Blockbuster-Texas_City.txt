  HITCHCOCK MAN SAYS PRIZE OF $1 MILLION IN

$500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER GAME SETS TONE FOR 2011
(Austin) ­As 2010 draws to a close and bells of 2011 get ready to ring, Darrell M. Singer of Hitchcock says he has "one million reasons to be happy." "I won $1 million in $500,000,000 Blockbuster right before the new year starts," he said. "My girlfriend scratched the ticket for me, but she thought I had won only $1. When I looked at the ticket and saw the prize, I almost had a heart attack. I'll get to help my loved ones in 2011, and that's a great feeling." Between sitting in the parking lot of the retail location in Texas City where he bought the ticket and getting to Houston to collect his prize at the Texas Lottery claim center, Singer called his brother, his daughter and his sister, with whom he lives. "My brother and daughter are so happy, but my sister never answered her phone," he said. "She's in for a surprise." Singer said he bought one $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket because of one of his friends. "A young lady I know likes Blockbuster and wins regularly with it," he said. "I thought I could hit a good prize, too, but I never thought it would be the million dollars." The new winner says he buys lottery tickets only occasionally, "maybe on payday and one other time every month." After he helps his immediate family members, Singer says he will spend some of his cash on himself by getting a new truck.
