SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER FROM FORT WORTH WINS TWICE IN DALLAS COWBOYS SECOND-CHANCE DRAWINGS
(AUSTIN) ­ Albert Hunter of Fort Worth is living proof that perseverance pays off. He sent in his nonwinning Dallas Cowboys tickets for the second-chance drawings and won in two separate drawings. "I won a $100 gift certificate first and gave it to my wife. She bought some jewelry," said Hunter, who also plans to share his second prize with his wife. The pair will enjoy a Dallas Cowboys "Draft Party Trip" package for two. The package includes:     The opportunity to go inside the War Room on Draft Day for an inside look at the Dallas Cowboys draft player evaluation and strategies by Jerry Jones; Transportation on the Dallas Cowboys Luxury Bus to the official Dallas Cowboys Draft Party; Two VIP Passes to the Dallas Cowboys Draft Party; Transportation and hotel accommodations.

"The Dallas Cowboys game was such a success last year that we decided to bring it back bigger and better," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "The top prize has been raised to $250,000 and more second-chance prizes have been added." Featuring more than $43 million in cash and second-chance prizes, the Dallas Cowboys game offers instant-win prizes of $10 to $250,000. Overall odds of winning any instant prize are one in 3.47. Nonwinning tickets can be sent in for the second-chance drawings for prizes such as gift certificates, autographed jerseys, season tickets and exclusive trip packages. The next second-chance drawing will be held on January 11, and the deadline to enter is January 7.
