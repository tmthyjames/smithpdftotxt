TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT TO INCREASE FOR THURSDAY NIGHT'S DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­The Texas Two Step® jackpot for the drawing on Thursday, January 1, 2009, is being increased to $525,000 to accurately reflect ticket sales and free promotional tickets generated for the drawing. "The commission recently released an instant ticket game, Boot Scootin' Bucks, which provides a free Texas Two Step Quick Pick ticket as a prize. The original jackpot estimation of $450,000 did not account for the free Texas Two Step tickets, which, as has been the practice of the Texas Lottery, should be included in determining sales support for the advertised jackpot. Therefore, this jackpot increase is appropriate," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief.
