$100,000 SECOND-CHANCE WINNER FROM CORPUS CHRISTI STARTING NEW YEAR WITH A "BANG"
(AUSTIN) ­ It didn't take many tickets for Aaron Johnston to come out on top in a recent Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawing. Now, he will start 2011 right with a $100,000 prize. "I sent in other entries, but I played more of the $5 tickets. I didn't send in many of the $2," said Johnston. "When they told me I'd won on the $2 game, I thought, `That's really wild.'" Johnston enjoys playing Texas Lottery® scratch-off tickets and follows a simple system based on the game odds. He says it works well for him. "I look on the back of the card, and if it says the odds are one in 3.79, I buy 4." Introduced in May, the Jumbo Bucks III game features 21 instant-win prizes of $50,000 each, 11 of which remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any instant prize are one in 4.36, including break-even prizes. Players who don't win instantly can send in their non-winning tickets for the second-chance drawings, each offering a top prize of $100,000. Entries for the next drawing are due January 28, 2011. "Games with second-chance drawings are popular among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "After all, who wouldn't appreciate a second chance to win? Mr. Johnston's win reminds us that you don't have to buy a lot of tickets to win a big prize." Although he knows he'll keep playing his favorite scratch-off tickets, Johnston is less sure how he will use his prize money. "There are no plans for the money yet, but it will start my year off with a bang." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $242 million. Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $25 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $11 million.
