  HOUSTON RESIDENT WINS HOUSTON TEXANS SEASON TICKETS FOR 2011 AND 2012 IN SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(Austin) ­ There is a small competition going on between Houston resident Daxton Riley and his wife as to which of them is the bigger Houston Texans fan. They may learn the answer when they attend the home games of their favorite team now that Riley has claimed a pair of tickets to the 2011 and 2012 seasons. "I'm the biggest Houston Texans fan there is, except for my wife, maybe," he said. "We're so happy, and we plan to go to every game and cheer on our team." Riley entered his non-winning Houston Texans scratch-off tickets in a Texas Lottery® secondchance drawing. The prize he won is the "VIP Texans Season Tickets Package for 2 Years" that also includes a Texans Merchandise Gift Bag with two Texans hats, two Texans t-shirts and $50 in Texans Bucks that can be spent on concessions or merchandise at the home games. "This prize offers a fantastic opportunity to enjoy Houston Texans football not just for one season, but for two," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Mr. Riley and his wife will be enjoying the games sitting between the 30-yard lines both seasons." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $242 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $11 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $25 million. More information about the Texas Lottery is on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
