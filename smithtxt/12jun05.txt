Diboll Mega MillionsTM Winner, 'A Nervous Wreck All Night,' Doesn't Wait To Claim $700,000 Prize

Bobbie Coleman of Diboll can rest easy now. She claimed her $700,000 Mega Millions prize a day after finding out she won.

(Austin, June 2) - It seemed last night took an eternity to end before Bobbie Coleman of Diboll could claim her $700,000 Mega MillionsTM prize. She presented her Mega Millions ticket shortly after 8 a.m. this morning at the Texas Lottery® Tyler Claim Center. "I'm a nervous wreck. I had to wait overnight to come, and it lasted forever," said Coleman. "I just found out yesterday evening I had a winning ticket. The clerk at the little store I stop said I had won $175,000. I've done everything but fall on the floor because

I'm so excited." Coleman purchased her ticket at the Diboll Food Mart at 500 North Temple. For an additional dollar, she also elected to purchase her ticket with the Megaplier feature, effectively turning her $175,000 prize into $700,000. "I always play the Megaplier," said Coleman. "It's my favorite part of the game." "The Megaplier feature, offered only in Texas, is a favorite for many of our Mega Millions players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "For players, the added bonus of a chance at doubling, tripling or quadrupling a non-jackpot prize translates into a bonus to the state, as well; to the tune of $34,805,772 in additional revenue since the inception of the Mega Millions game feature." For every Megaplier dollar spent in Texas, approximately 47 cents of that is transferred to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in Texas. For every Mega Millions ticket bought in Texas, approximately 38 cents of each dollar is transferred to the fund. "Everyone in Diboll knows I won," Coleman said. "I even had a marriage proposal. I think I'll just put this money in the bank, though, pay off some bills, and sit back for a while." Because there were no tickets sold in the 11 Mega Millions states that matched all five numbers and the Mega Ball for Tuesday night's jackpot, the estimated Mega Millions jackpot for Friday night is worth $106 million. The Mega Millions numbers for the May 31 drawing were: 05 - 13 - 22 - 37 - 38, and the Mega Ball number was 11.
