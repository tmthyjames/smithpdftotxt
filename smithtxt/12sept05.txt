SAN ANTONIO MAN WINS MONTHLY BONUS, GETS $ 10,000 PER MONTH TO KEEP PRESCRIPTION COSTS AT BAY
(AUSTIN, September 1) - (AUSTIN) ­ J. Wesley Brooks reinvested a $6 Lottery win in one Monthly Bonus ticket and came away with the top prize, $10,000 per month for 20 years that he says he'll put to good use immediately. "Our medical bills have gone up to nearly $12,000 a year," Brooks said. "It's mostly prescriptions, but that's what I'll be using this prize for, to pay for those medical expenses for my wife and me." Brooks wasted no time in coming to Lottery Headquarters to claim his prize. He purchased the ticket that held the top prize on Monday. "I'd just come back from the grocery store and was sitting in the kitchen shaking," he said. "My wife and daughter didn't believe me when I told them what I'd won. The clerk at the store told me I'd won the big prize, which was more than he could pay me." He stashed the ticket in a safe and called the Lottery to find out what to do. The $5 ticket Monthly Bonus scratch game features 20 ways to win. Players can win cash prizes from $5 to $10,000 per month for 20 years, not to exceed $2,400,000. As of today, there is still one more top prize left to claim. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 3.61. Brooks purchased his winning ticket at Fiesta Food Mart, 2111 Harry Wurzbach Road, in San Antonio. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold a top-prize-winning ticket. Friday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $131 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
