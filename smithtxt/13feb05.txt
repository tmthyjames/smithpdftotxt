Father, Daughter Make Great Team When Playing Texas Lottery® Games
(Austin, February 1) - Anabelle Castillo and her father have been playing Texas Lottery® games for a long time and they've got their system down perfectly. Castillo takes her father grocery shopping every Friday, and every Friday they take the opportunity to stop and get Pick 3®, Cash Five® and Lotto Texas® tickets for the upcoming drawings. "We spend $20 a week. My father really likes his Pick 3 and Cash Five games. He always said if those tickets ever win, we would split the prize," Castillo said. "I called him Friday morning to tell him that we had won the lottery. He thought I meant the jackpot; the $57 million one. He asked that in the future I be more specific when telling him which game we won." Castillo said her dad was still excited, though, about their Cash Five prize, $17,822. The pair bought the five-of-five matching ticket at Stop N Go, located at 9022 Marbach Road in San Antonio. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $178.22 for selling the prize-winning ticket. "It sounds like these two Texas Lottery players make a good team," said Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Since Cash Five began in 1995, we've awarded nearly $900 million in cash prizes to players. I look forward to hearing about the many more Cash Five winners who I'm positive will follow." Castillo told lottery officials she plans on using her half of the winnings to pay for a vacation cruise for her anniversary and may be a family vacation to Disney World. "The reason you play is to win," she said. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org ...
