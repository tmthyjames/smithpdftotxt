Triple Digits In Texas; And We Don't Mean The Temperature
(Austin, June 1) - Texans are seeing triple digits in the Lone Star State, but not on their thermometer readings. It's on all the Mega MillionsTM billboards across the state, because, once again, the jackpot is currently worth more than $100 million. "We're going into the summer months in Texas, and most of us know what that does to the temperature outside. While we can't do anything about that, we can offer players a chance to walk away with a 'cool' $106 million jackpot prize, though," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's the fourth time this calendar year that the Mega Millions jackpot has reached a triple-digit level." There were no tickets sold in the 11 Mega Millions states that matched all five numbers and the Mega Ball for last night's advertised $92 million jackpot. The Mega Millions numbers for the May 31 drawing were: 05 - 13 - 22 - 37 - 38 and the Mega Ball number was 11. Two Tickets Sold There were two tickets sold in Texas for the second-tier prize of $175,000. One ticket was sold in El Paso at the Circle K store, located at 4501 Woodrow Bean Trans Mountain Drive. The other ticket, sold in Diboll (just south of Lufkin) was purchased at the Diboll Food Mart at 500 North Temple. That ticket was purchased with the MegaplierTM feature and is actually worth $700,000, as the Megaplier number from last night's drawing was a 4. "In addition to those two tickets, there were more than 46,000 other tickets that matched for cash prizes totaling more than $225,000," Greer said. "Of those tickets, more than 9,000 were purchased with the Texas Lottery Megaplier feature." The Megaplier feature, played only in Texas, allows players the chance to double, triple or quadruple any Mega Millions non-grand/jackpot prize. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Texas Lottery
