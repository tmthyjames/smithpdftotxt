Texas Lottery Ad Takes First Place In National Competition
(Austin, October 25) - - Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud announced today that the Texas Lottery won first place in a national awards competition for lottery advertising. The Texas Lottery won a "Batchy" award in the category of "Off-line Games" for its "Hoedown" television commercial. The ad was produced as part of the lottery's Instant Game advertising campaign. Produced by Fogarty, Klein, Monroe in Houston, the ad features coins used to "scratch off" tickets dancing to a hoedown tune. Sponsored by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL), the "Batchy" awards are named for Ralph Batchy, an industry pioneer involved in the start-up of lotteries in New Jersey, Illinois and Delaware. He was the first president of the NASL, the organization that later became NASPL, and championed quality lottery advertising as a vehicle for helping lotteries gain public acceptance. The Texas Lottery Commission was also a finalist in seven categories, including radio advertising, corporate communications and web site home page. -30.... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
