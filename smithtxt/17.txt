Texas Lottery Signs Nine-Year Contract With GTECH
(Austin, October 11) - - Enhanced services, faster ticket machines and the lowest rate Texas has ever paid are among the benefits of a new nine-year contract signed today by Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud and David J. Calabro, Executive Vice-President of Global Operations for the GTECH Corporation. "We're very pleased to sign this contract with the GTECH Corporation," said Cloud. "The benefits of this agreement will provide better services to our retailers and players, provide greater value to the State of Texas, and ensure the Texas Lottery Commission remains an innovative leader in the industry for many years to come." The new contract, negotiated after a competitive bidding process, reduces GTECH's current contract rate from 3.05 percent of sales to 2.6999 percent of sales, effective September 1, 2002. This rate, which is lower than the original amount GTECH first proposed in August, resulted from ongoing negotiations between both parties. "I am very pleased with the Commission's progress and proud of this final contract," said C. Thomas Clowe, Jr., Chairman of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The new rate justifies this longer term contract, and in my view, will be very beneficial to the State of Texas during the extended contract period." The current five-year extension contract between the Texas Lottery and GTECH, which was awarded in May 1996, expires on August 31, 2002. That contract reduced the rate that GTECH charged the state through a declining rate scale, which will end at 3.05 percent of sales. "It is my understanding," Cloud said, "that for the full range of services we are receiving, the rate we are agreeing to today is one of the lowest rates ever offered for a unique contract of this size that provides these goods and services." Under terms of the new contract negotiated by Cloud, GTECH will also:
