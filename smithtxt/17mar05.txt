Wild 10's Instant Winner Stays 'Cool and Collected'

Monique Buchanan of Boerne says she plans on getting a least one new vehicle with her Wild 10's prize - a tractor.

(Austin, March 8) - Monique Buchanan of Boerne says she and her husband aren't going to go crazy with their winnings from the Texas Lottery®. Yesterday, Buchanan and her husband visited the Texas Lottery San Antonio Claim Center to collect her top cash prize from the Wild 10's scratch game - a cool $110,000. "My husband asked me if I wanted a new car, but I told him the one I drive now is just

fine," she said. "We're getting a new tractor though. We can enjoy ourselves without going overboard. Maybe a vacation." Buchanan's $110,000 prize is one of nine top prizes in the Wild 10's scratch game. She purchased her ticket at Pico #11 at 37100 IH 10 West in Boerne. Buchanan works as a security officer at Boerne High School, and her husband is a Bexar County Deputy Sheriff. "New vehicles seem to be one of the first items our big prizewinners say they want to purchase, and I think a tractor quantifies as a type of vehicle," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "I'm happy to hear that it won't be all work and no play for the Buchanans, and that they plan to enjoy a little relaxation, too, with their prize money." As of today, there are still eight top prizes available in the Wild 10's scratch game. The cost to play is $10.
