Texas Two StepTM Winner "Just Had A Feeling"
(Austin, October 10) - - It was only the third time Vergie Shelton played the Texas Lottery's newest game but it turned out to be the charm - she won the largest Texas Two Step jackpot since the game began last May. The seventy-six year old Port Lavaca retiree represents the S and R Partnership, which claimed the $1.25 million jackpot at Lottery headquarters in Austin today. Shelton and her friend, Roy Rubalcaba, had stopped at the Times Market #103, located at 1749 Austin in Port Lavaca, on September 1st, three days before the drawing. Shelton said she "just had a feeling" about this game. "I walked into the market and the Texas Two Step display just jumped out at me," Shelton said. "I bought five dollars worth of tickets and told Roy, 'We'll win something with this.' " That something turned out to be $1,250,000 before taxes. Shelton plans to share her winnings with Rubalcaba and her family. She says "it's only right," since the numbers that won have a special meaning for her family. The numbers drawn were: 1-11-17-25 and the Bonus Ball was also 17. Shelton said she picked the number "1" because January was her grandson Mike's birthday. Mike died in a car accident on August 21, 2000. Vergie pointed out that the jackpot that would eventually grow to the $1.25 million she won, rolled for the first time on August 21, 2001, the day his family marked the one year anniversary of his death. Number "11" is her daughter's birthday and "25" represents the year Shelton was born. The number "17," which came up twice, was picked at random. "Mike always took care of the family," Shelton said. "Now, I'll be able to help out his family." Texas Two Step has produced 30 top-prize winners. There have been two other Texas Two Step jackpots that totaled over $1 million.
