It Takes Little Time For Glenn Heights Man To Collect Top Prize For Wild 10's Scratch Game

Perserverence pays off: Bobby Madden of Glenn Heights won Wild 10's top prize of $110,000 on the eighth ticket he bought!

(Austin, April 29) - Bobby Madden of Glenn Heights stopped for a tank of gas and four Texas Lottery® WILD 10'S scratch games. When he didn't win a prize on his first goround, he decided to give it four more shots. "I won the top prize on the eighth ticket," Madden said. "I couldn't believe it. I went back inside the store to show the clerk. Then I high-tailed it back to the truck and called to get directions to the nearest claim center." While claiming his $110,000 cash prize, yesterday, Madden called his wife to tell her the good news. "We're going to build a new house with this money," he told lottery officials. "We just had a baby recently, and it's getting a little cramped with us, an 11-year-old and, now, a 3month-old. We really needed this."

Madden makes the fifth top-prize winner in the lottery's WILD 10'S scratch game. To date, there are still four $110,000 prizes left to claim. Other cash prizes for the instant ticket range from $10 to $5,000. "Mr. Madden has certainly had his share of 'bundles of joy' in 2005," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "A new baby girl and now a bundle of cash. We wish him, and his growing family, all the best, and good luck with the expansion of that new house." Madden purchased his ticket at the Seagoville Chevron at 1001 North Highway 175 in Seagoville.
