Grand Prairie Resident Claims Final Top Prize For Texas Lottery® Viva Las Vegas Scratch Game
(Austin, December 15) - Bernadette A. Jones of Grand Prairie today became the third and final top-prize winner for the Texas Lottery® Viva Las Vegas Scratch-Off game. The $1 million prize, before taxes, was paid in a single lump-sum payment. "The Viva Las Vegas game has been one of our most popular Scratch-Off games," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "And even though all the million dollar prizes have been paid, there are still lots of second-tier prizes left unclaimed. That means the next Viva Las Vegas ticket our players scratch could have them seeing green, $10,000 worth of green." Jones purchased her winning ticket at Kroger's, located at 2525 West I-20 in Grand Prairie. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. The same retail location received a bonus of $250,000 in January 2003 for selling a Lotto Texas® ticket that matched all six numbers for a $53 million jackpot. The ticket was one of two for the jackpot drawn on January 22, 2003. As of today, there are still 18 second-tier prizes of $10,000 left unclaimed. Other cash prizes in the Viva Las Vegas Scratch-Off game range from $20 to $1,000. The overall odds of winning a prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 2.79. The winner has requested minimum publicity. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org ...
