Marble Falls Man Shows Favoritism Toward Some Texas Lottery® Games
(Austin, June 30) - While picking up his $20,000 top prize for the Texas Lottery® Triple Bankroll scratch game, Everett Pickens told lottery officials he has his favorites when it comes to playing the Games of Texas. "Any of the winning tickets," he explained. "This ticket (Triple Bankroll) was the last of six I had bought and scratched at home. I looked at it three times, and still had to get my wife to look at it, too." Pickens bought his winning ticket at Round Up Food & Fuel, located at 808 Highway 281in Marble Falls. Besides the top prize of $20,000, the Triple Bankroll scratch game features prizes of $2 to $1,000. Overall odds of winning a prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.12. "Most of, if not all, our players probably have the same 'favorite' Texas Lottery game as Mr. Pickens," said Texas Lottery Commission Products Manager Robert Tirloni. "Congratulations to him for winning such a great prize on one of his favorite games." And just what does the 66-year-old Marble Falls resident plan to do with his winnings? He said he plans on buying a laptop. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
