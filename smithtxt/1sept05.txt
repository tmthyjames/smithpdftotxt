Two Cash FiveTM Top-Prize Claims Make For A Busy Morning At Tyler Claim Center
(Austin, September 30) - Two tickets matched all five numbers in Wednesday night's Cash FiveTM drawing, and the holders of both tickets were at the Texas Lottery® claim center in Tyler bright and early Thursday morning to claim their prizes ­ $14,764 each. The first Cash Five top-prize claimant of the morning was James E. Ervin of Tyler. Ervin purchased his ticket at the Kam Club Food Mart in Tyler. The ink on Ervin's check was barely dry when Tony Glen Key of Kilgore arrived to claim his prize. Key bought his ticket at Zippy J's in Kilgore. Each of the retailers is eligible to receive a bonus of $147.64 (one percent of the top prize) for selling the winning tickets. "All of our claim centers see their share of big winners, and Tyler is no exception," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "But two top-prize claims in the same game, on the same morning, at the same place is bound to be a pretty rare event." Retailers may, and are encouraged to, pay prizes up to and including $599. Prizes of $600 to $999,999 may be claimed at any of the 16 Texas Lottery claim centers, and all prizes up to $999,999 may be claimed by mail. Prizes of $1 million or more, and all prizes that are paid out in annuity payments must be claimed at the Texas Lottery Commission Headquarters in Austin. Prizes of $25 or more also require a claim form for processing. For more information about the Texas Lottery Commission, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
