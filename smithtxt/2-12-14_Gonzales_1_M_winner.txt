POWERBALL JACKPOT ROLLS TO $284 MILLION FOR TONIGHT'S DRAWING

(AUSTIN) ­ Benton C. Lewis of Gonzales claimed a $1 million second-tier Powerball® prize from the drawing held Feb. 8.

With no tickets matching all of the numbers plus the Powerball number, the jackpot rolled to an impressive $284 million for tonight's drawing.

Lewis purchased the winning ticket at The B & J Liquor at 730 Seydler St. in Gonzales.
