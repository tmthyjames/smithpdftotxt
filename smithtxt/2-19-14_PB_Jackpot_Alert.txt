TEXANS TAKING CHANCE ON $400 MILLION POWERBALL® JACKPOT
Tonight's jackpot is sixth largest jackpot of any U.S. lottery game on record

(AUSTIN) ­Texas Lottery® players have the chance to play for an estimated $400 million Powerball® jackpot prize for tonight's drawing. The jackpot's cash value is $227.8 million. Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Tonight's jackpot is the result of 15 drawings without a jackpot winner. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (159) and the red Powerball number (1-35). There are eight other ways to win non-jackpot prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million or up to $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play. The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The overall odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510. Powerball's Match 5 prize of $1 million, or $2 million if the ticket includes Power Play®, gives players more chances to become a millionaire. In the past year in Texas, 25 winning tickets worth $1 million or more have been sold, including a jackpot prize of $40 million.

Powerball is played in 45 U.S. lottery jurisdictions. Powerball is facilitated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a government-benefit, non-profit association owned and operated by 33 member U.S. lotteries. Powerball® drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays at 9:59 p.m. Central Time.
