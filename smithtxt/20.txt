Texas Two Step Game Giving Port Lavaca Players Something To Talk About
(Austin, September 27) - - The "Games of Texas" sometime seem to take up residence in certain Texas towns. In April, there were five jackpot-winning Lotto Texas tickets sold in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. In August, there were two top-prize winning Cash 5 tickets sold in Laredo, and now in September it seems Texas Two Step has found a home in Port Lavaca. On September 4th, a single winning ticket was sold for the largest Texas Two Step jackpot to date, $1.25 million. As of today, that prize has not been claimed. On September 21st, five women who pool their lottery money every week matched the four winning numbers plus the Bonus Ball for the jackpot prize of $700,000. "We've been playing Texas Two Step since it started," said Sarah Peavy, a member of the group. "A couple of us won on the first drawing and we've kept trying since then." Four of the group members work at the Calhoun County Senior Center, and the fifth member is a client of the center. Peavy has been the Senior Center Director for 24 years. The other members of the group include Iduvina Lauritsen, Mary Nash, Gloria Stewart and Laura Lambert. The winning ticket was purchased at Diamond Shamrock #125, located at 1104 N. Virginia in Port Lavaca. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of $7,000, one percent of the jackpot prize. The winning numbers were 01-05-25-24, with 07 drawn as the Bonus Ball. "I plan on paying some bills and giving my brother the $10,000 he loaned me in the past," said Peavy. "We also plan on sharing some with our fellow co-workers. "We had one more person put money in this week for Tuesday's Texas Two Step game," she added. Since the first drawing on May 18th, there have been 27 jackpot-winning Texas Two Step tickets sold, for a total of $9,223,770. The jackpot for Friday's Texas Two Step drawing is $200,000. -30NOTE TO EDITORS: Pictures are available of the Port Lavaca winners by e-mail in jpg format.
