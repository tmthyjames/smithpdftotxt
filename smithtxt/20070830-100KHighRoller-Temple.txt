TEMPLE MAN DOESN'T MIND STOPPING FOR GAS AFTER $100,000 SCRATCH-OFF WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ Paying at the pump just got a little easier for James V. Still of Temple. After stopping for gas recently, he picked up a High Roller scratch-off ticket from the Texas Lottery® and suddenly became a "High Roller" himself. A regular scratch-off player, he's won as much as $1,000 in the past. This time he received the $100,000 top-prize, not bad for one stop at the gas station. However, it took Still a little while to realize what he had. "I scratched it at work," he said. "When I saw the numbers, I thought something's not right here." Because prizes from $600 to $999,999 must be awarded at one of the 16 regional claim centers, he made a surprise trip to Austin. "Everyone at work already knows I won. They told me to be careful because of the traffic in the morning, but I said I don't mind waiting in traffic for this." He joked, "I'll even be able to buy a few gallons of gas with the money." Of course, the gas pump won't get it all. Being a bit of a handyman, he plans to do some work on his house. The rest will go into savings. "We congratulate Mr. Still on his recent win," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "It's good to see the money used in a positive way not only for today, but also for the future."
