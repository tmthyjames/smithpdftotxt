FORTUNE COOKIES LEAD TO $750,000 PRIZE FOR MEGA MILLIONS® SECOND-TIER WINNER
(AUSTIN) ­ Using several different sets of lucky numbers, most borrowed from fortune cookies, San Marcos resident Jeff Bondurant regularly plays the Lotto Texas® and Mega Millions® games. He likes to get his tickets from one store in particular, the Quix located at 3404 Lockhart Highway in Austin, sometimes joking with the clerks about a possible win. On December 14, it finally happened. Five numbers on his ticket matched those drawn, 4 ­ 30 ­ 7 ­ 17 ­ 12. Only the Mega Ball number, 44, differed. Bondurant checked his ticket against the results on the Texas Lottery® Web site. "I read the numbers twice, then three times," he said. "We just can't believe it." Monday morning he came to Austin to claim the second-tier prize. Because his ticket included the Megaplier® option, Bondurant's prize increased to $750,000. "For one dollar more per play, Mega Millions players in Texas have the chance to Megaply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, or four times," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "That means you don't need to match every number to be eligible for an impressive prize. It's another fun option for Texas Lottery players."

Although excited, Bondurant still feels lucky and will keep trying to win the grand prize. Until then, his plan is simple. "We can pay off some bills," he said. "It's going to be a very merry Christmas." Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million.
