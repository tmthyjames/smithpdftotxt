GRANBURY MAN CLAIMS $3 MILLION SCRATCH-OFF PRIZE BETWEEN TRIPS
(AUSTIN) ­ After returning from a trip to Shreveport, David B. Selle of Granbury stopped to get some Mega Millions® tickets. As he waited, he noticed the Millions and Millions scratch-off was nearing the end of the pack and decided to take a chance on the $30 ticket. Selle always checks the back of the ticket for the minimum prize amounts before he starts scratching. He revealed the numbers one at a time, expecting to win $40. Instead, he uncovered the first of four $3 million prizes offered in the instant ticket game. "I called my sister. Then I called my boss and asked for a day off," said Selle. "I knew I wouldn't get much sleep last night."

On the advice of a friend, he came to Austin right away to claim his prize. He only has a limited amount of time before his next trip begins; this time he's going to Las Vegas. "Mr. Selle obviously enjoys traveling, and we hope his win will help him enjoy his upcoming trip," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. Although his boss worried his big win might have him traveling indefinitely, Selle isn't so sure. After 27 years at the same job, he says, "It's hard to walk away." Besides, he's won before. Selle has claimed scratch-off prizes of as much as $1,000 and even matched four of the five Cash 5® numbers a couple of times. Gunny's Lakeside Grocery at 2316 Lipan Highway in Granbury may also benefit from Selle's luck. The retailer is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $179 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $25 million.
