HOUSTON MAN CLAIMS $1 MILLION VALENTINE FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®
(AUSTIN) ­ Some people were enjoying candy hearts and flowers yesterday, but Mega Millions® player Shehu Zibili of Houston received something a bit more substantial from the Texas Lottery®, a $1 million prize. He matched all of the numbers for the January 29 drawing except the Mega Ball (8 ­ 23 ­ 39 ­ 40 ­ 42, Mega Ball: 24). While that would normally qualify him for a $250,000 prize, his decision to Megaply® boosted his winnings by four times that amount. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry explains, "Texas Lottery players have a unique opportunity to increase their non-jackpot winnings by two, three or four times with the Megaplier add-n feature. This time, the extra dollar paid off in a big way." Mr. Zibili requested minimal publicity. He purchased his lucky ticket at the Lakeside Shell, 2706 W. Sam Houston Parkway in Houston. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $179 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $25 million.
