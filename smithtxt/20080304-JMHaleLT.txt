JM HALE, LP, CLAIMS ONE OF TWO LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT PRIZES
(AUSTIN) ­ The February 23 Lotto Texas® drawing boasted an impressive $28 million jackpot. That night, multiple Texas Lottery® players also got bragging rights when two tickets matched all six numbers drawn: 2, 7, 21, 35, 43, and 50. JM Hale, LP, of Addison, represented by John M. Hale, claimed half of the total jackpot today, taking the annuity option that provides $14,323,430.98 before taxes. The claimant requested minimal publicity. The Tom Thumb located at 14280 Marsh Lane in Addison is eligible to receive a $143,234 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $26 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million.
