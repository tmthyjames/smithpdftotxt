MEGA MILLIONS® PLAYER DOESN'T NEED JACKPOT WIN TO CLAIM $1 MILLION PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ With the estimated jackpot reaching $95 million for tonight's drawing, many Mega Millions® players have their sights set on the big prize. However, Joseph G. Tykal of Navasota was content with being a runner-up. Because he chose the Megaplier® option, his second-tier prize quadrupled to an impressive $1 million. Tykal won with a Quick Pick ticket purchased from Clint's Supermarket located on Highway 90 at FM 1774 in Anderson. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
