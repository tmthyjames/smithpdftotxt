ROYSE CITY RESIDENT CLAIMS $77,777 POT OF GOLD
(AUSTIN) ­ Lucky sevens, four-leaf clovers and rainbows ending in pots of gold cover the Texas Lottery® Lucky Times 7 scratch-off game. Some of the luck from those charms must have rubbed off on Michael Windham of Royse City this week when he won the game's top prize of $77,777. "After scratching off the ticket, I looked it over and expected to lose," he said. "Then I noticed my numbers matched." Still, he never completely accepted his good fortune. "I had to look it over four or five times before I decided it was real," explained Windham. "I still don't believe it." Windham purchased his ticket from the Allen Shell located at 1106 E. Bethany Drive in Allen. As of Monday, 12 top prizes remained unclaimed.
