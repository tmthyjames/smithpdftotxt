SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION PLAYING "SPECTACULAR" SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ There are only three prizes of $1 million or more left in the first-ever $50 scratch-off from the Texas Lottery®. Vinh Quang Tran of San Antonio claimed a $1 million prize today in the $130 Million Spectacular. One prize of $1 million and two prizes of $5 million each still remain unclaimed. However, Tran may not be the only one to reap the rewards of this win. The retailer, Big Diamond #1028 at 6022 US Highway 87 East in San Antonio, is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $60 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $6 million.
