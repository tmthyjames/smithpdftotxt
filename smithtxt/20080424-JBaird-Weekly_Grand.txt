WEEKLY GRAND WIN NO LONGER JUST A DREAM FOR SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER
(AUSTIN) ­ Sometimes, dreams do come true. Jeremy Baird of Houston plays the Texas Lottery® Weekly Grand instant ticket game and has for years. A fan of all scratch-off games, he enjoys that ticket the most, and he's won a number of prizes playing the game. "I've won $100 here, $40 there," said Baird. "I've always dreamed of winning the Weekly Grand. A thousand dollars a week would let me put myself through college." His dream became a reality when Baird stopped at a local retailer with his mother and daughter. Just before he checked the tickets, his daughter gave him a kiss for good luck. It must have worked.

"I got two tickets and won $4 on the first," he explained. "Then I won the grand." Baird will receive $1,000 per week for 20 years. This is the third of four top prizes in the game, now a perennial favorite. Overall odds are one in 3.91, including break-even prizes. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry noted, "Our annuity games such as Weekly Grand, Monthly Bonus and Set For Life continue to be popular among players. Many like the idea of receiving payouts year after year, which adds extra excitement to the games." Baird's top-prize win may also benefit the Quick 1 Food Mart located at 7181 Dixie Drive in Houston, which is now eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. Don't assume you've seen the last of Baird. He says he'll continue to play and, hopefully, win. Said Baird, "After this, I'll definitely keep going." Tonight's Texas Two Step® drawing boasts an advertised jackpot of $1.4 million, and tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $71 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
