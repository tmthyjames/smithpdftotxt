A JOURNEY FROM HOUSTON TO AUSTIN TO SET FOR LIFE
(AUSTIN) ­ The mission was clear ­ ride a bike from Houston to Austin to benefit charity. However, the destination was a complete surprise. When the dust settled, the Ripper & Ripper Partnership of Humble ended up at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters. Partnership representative Tim Cronin visits Texas every year to participate in the MS150, benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He and four of his brothers brave the two-day ride together, but this year they went home with more than just the memories.

Cronin's brother bought him a Texas Lottery® Set For Life instant ticket before he returned to Colorado. Cronin began scratching and noticed something strange. Instead of a number, one square had the word LIFE printed in bold. "I asked my brother what it meant," he said. "We read the fine print at the bottom, but I still wasn't convinced." In fact, he'd just uncovered the top prize, $5,000 a week for 20 years, not to exceed $5,000,000. One top prize remains in the popular instant ticket game with overall odds of one in 3.47, including break-even prizes. "We are always happy to greet new winners," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "However, it is especially gratifying to see a top prize go to those who so clearly embody our own core values of integrity and teamwork. This partnership deserves recognition for giving back to the community, and we wish them well in their future endeavors." Also benefiting from the brothers' luck, the Handi Stop #40 located at 6355 Will Clayton Parkway in Humble is eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the top-prize winning ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $166 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million.
