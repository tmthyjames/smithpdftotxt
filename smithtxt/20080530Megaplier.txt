MEGAPLIER® OPTION RESULTS IN $1 MILLION WIN FOR EMORY MAN
(AUSTIN) ­ Clayton M. Miller of Emory journeyed all the way from northeast Texas to the Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin this week to claim $1 million from the May 23 Mega Millions® drawing. His ticket matched five of the numbers drawn: 11 ­ 8 ­ 22 ­ 4 ­ 30. However, he missed the Mega Ball: 4. Though this would normally qualify him for a $250,000 prize, Miller had the foresight to select the Megaplier® option, which multiplied his winnings to four times that amount. Miller, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his winning ticket from the Buffalo Stop 1 located at 605 Highway 69 South in Lone Oak. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is estimated to be worth $16 million, and tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is estimated to be worth $17 million.
