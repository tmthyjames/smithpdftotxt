LOTTO TEXAS® PLAYER FROM SAN ANTONIO HITS THE JACKPOT
(AUSTIN) ­Saturday, May 31, will likely be a day Eddie Dreamkowski of San Antonio remembers for the rest of his life because that was the night his numbers were drawn, 18 ­ 19 ­ 26 ­ 29 ­ 32 ­ 42. Dreamkowski selected the Cash Value Option, which makes his $17 million Lotto Texas® jackpot prize worth $10.4 million. He purchased his ticket from the Step N Go, 3532 Hunt Lane in San Antonio. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $170,000 for selling the jackpot-winning ticket. Dreamkowski requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $36 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $5 million.
