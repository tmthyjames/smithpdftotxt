BRIDGE CITY RESIDENT WINS JUMBO BUCKS
(AUSTIN) ­ On her way to a graduation in Killeen, Shanna Hubert of Bridge City stopped at the Pit Stop Food Marts, 12792 Highway 105 East in Cut `N Shoot, and she bought several Texas Lottery® scratch-off tickets. Hubert won $9 on one ticket. Then she scratched her Jumbo Bucks ticket, but she couldn't believe her eyes. The ticket was worth a whopping $20,000. She had to check the ticket several times before reality set in. "I'm very excited," said Hubert. "This sure has come in handy." Since its introduction in early May, the latest Jumbo Bucks game has paid six top prizes of $20,000 each, with 11 still unclaimed. The overall odds of winning, including break-even prizes, are one in 4.59.
