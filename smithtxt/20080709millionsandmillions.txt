LOYAL PLAYER ENJOYS $20,000 WIN FROM MILLIONS & MILLIONS SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Walter Slezinsky claims five to ten years as a Texas Lottery® scratch-off player. During that time, he's won a number of prizes including one $5,000 prize several years ago, but not one of those wins measures up to the $20,000 prize he claimed Tuesday. Still, the El Campo resident isn't one to brag. "I scratched the ticket there at the store," explained Slezinsky. "Then I told the owner I won a couple of dollars." According to Slezinsky, he knew immediately what he'd won, and it didn't take long to decide how to use the money. "I'm going to pay some bills and eat a steak," he laughed. "I'm going to party!"

Millions & Millions, a $30 scratch-off game, has paid out 24 prizes of $20,000 and even one prize of $3,000,000. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 2.43, including break-even prizes. "Our higher price point tickets have become popular with some players because of the improved odds of winning," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "However, we do remind our players to enjoy these games responsibly. After all, it only takes one ticket to win." The L Stop located at 411 N. Wharton St. in El Campo sold the $20,000 winning ticket. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $75 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $14 million.
