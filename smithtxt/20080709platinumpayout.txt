Graham of El Paso claimed another, leaving four $1 million and three $5 million prizes remaining in the $130,000,000 Platinum Payout. Both claimants requested minimal publicity. C C's Package Store at 163 FM 2483 in Morgan's Point Resort and Big Diamond #1363 at 629 S. Yarbrough in El Paso are each eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000 after selling these winning tickets.
