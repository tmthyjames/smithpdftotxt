DEADLINE NEARS TO CLAIM $1 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® TICKET FROM EL PASO
(AUSTIN) ­ With only six weeks to go, the clock is winding down on a Mega Millions® ticket worth $1 million. The ticket, if not claimed, will expire on August 31. Someone purchased the winning ticket at the Cash It Here #5 located at 9155 Dyer, Suite A, in El Paso. The ticket matched all five numbers for the March 4 drawing (7 ­ 15 ­ 30 ­ 33 ­ 56), but it failed to match the Mega Ball (22). Because the purchaser chose to Megaply®, the second-tier prize quadrupled to $1 million. "We urge our players in and around El Paso to check their couch cushions, nightstands, wallets and pocketbooks for the winning Mega Millions ticket," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Players still have time to claim this prize at any of our regional claim centers." Two Mega Millions tickets worth $1 million each were sold in El Paso for the March 4 drawing. One has already been claimed by the Mendez Brothers Partnership on March 28. In most cases, ticket holders have 180 days to claim their prize. If the prize remains unclaimed after the deadline, it becomes part of the unclaimed prize fund. Texas allocates the first $10 million in unclaimed prizes each fiscal year to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB)
