MONTHLY BONUS WINNER FROM ELMENDORF TO RECEIVE $2.4 MILLION PAYOUT OVER 20 YEARS
(AUSTIN) ­ Shirley J. Martin of Elmendorf came to Austin to claim a Monthly Bonus prize worth $10,000 per month for the next 20 years, up to a total of $2,400,000. "Our instant games that pay out over time prove popular year after year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "Weekly Grand, Set For Life and, of course, Monthly Bonus allow the feelings of winning to persist long after the scratching is done." The claimant requested minimal publicity. The Diamond Food Mart #3, located at 451 Hot Wells Blvd. in San Antonio, is eligible for a $10,000 bonus for selling this winning ticket. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $11 million.
