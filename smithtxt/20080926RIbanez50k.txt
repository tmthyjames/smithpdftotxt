FIVE PROVES LUCKY FOR GROVETON RESIDENT
(AUSTIN) ­ Move over seven, there's a new lucky number in Groveton. Local resident Robinette J. Ibañez paid $5 for a Red Hot 5's scratch-off ticket from the Texas Lottery® and claimed the fifth top prize of $50,000. "I'm still in shock. We still don't believe it," said Ibañez. "This is the answer to our prayers." Despite their emotional win, Ibañez and her husband have kept cool heads about their plans for the money. They will use it to help their son finish law school. "While the coincidence of so many fives coming together in this win is remarkable, it is also noteworthy that the family plans to use the money toward an educational goal," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "After all, the Texas Lottery's main goal is supporting education through the Foundation School Fund."
