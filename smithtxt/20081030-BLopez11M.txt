LOTTO TEXAS® WINNER FROM CORPUS CHRISTI FOCUSES ON FAITH AND FAMILY IN HARD TIMES
(AUSTIN) ­ When Corpus Christi resident Bilma V. Lopez found out that her two-year-old grandson had been diagnosed with autism, she relied on her faith to see her family through. "I prayed, `Lord give us what we need to make his life better'," explained Lopez. She says her prayers were first answered as her family found strength in each other. Then Lopez received another kind of answer when her numbers came up in the October 18 Lotto Texas® drawing, worth an estimated $18 million. After realizing that her ticket matched the six numbers drawn, 7 ­ 14 ­ 16 ­ 35 ­ 48 ­ 52, she brought her Quick Pick ticket to Texas Lottery® headquarters. There Lopez claimed the jackpot's $11,053,346.40 cash value. The claimant requested minimal publicity. For selling the winning ticket, the Stripes #7137, at 7122 S. Staples St. in Corpus Christi, is eligible for a retailer bonus of $180,000. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $475,000. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $23 million.
