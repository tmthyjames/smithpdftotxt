MAGNIFICENT MILLIONS GAME MINTS TWO NEW MILLIONAIRES THIS WEEK
(AUSTIN) ­ It happened on Monday, and just two days later it happened again. Two Texans became millionaires this week by playing the Magnificent Millions scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. Early in the week, Gilberto Garcia Rodriguez of San Antonio claimed a top prize. Then Abilene resident Martha Nigro won on Wednesday. Introduced in May, the Magnificent Millions game features more than $60.1 million in prizes. Four top prizes remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.08, including break-even prizes. The Sun Stop Market located at 1009A Jackson Keller Road in San Antonio sold Rodriguez his winning ticket. Nigro purchased her ticket at the Allsup's #301, 2702 Ambler Ave. in Abilene. Each retailer is now eligible for a $10,000 bonus. Both claimants requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is $225,000. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $62 million.
