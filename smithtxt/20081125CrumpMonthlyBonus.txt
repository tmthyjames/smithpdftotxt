WITH THANSKGIVING RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, SMALL TOWN MAN WINS BIG TIME MONTHLY BONUS
(AUSTIN) ­ Gary Crump of Coleman has 2.4 million new reasons to be thankful this year. Last week he walked into the Elkins Cut Rate, 616 North Neches Street in Coleman, and purchased a Monthly Bonus ticket from the Texas Lottery®, one of his favorite games. He uncovered each square, but his numbers weren't coming up. Then near the bottom of the ticket a dollar bill symbol appeared. Crump had scratched his way to the top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years, not to exceed $2,400,000. He looked closely at the ticket for a while and said, "Huh. I guess I'm going to retire." After convincing his wife that the ticket might be a winner, the two went back to the store to try to validate the prize. They say everyone in the store recognized the winning tone coming from the store's terminal. It didn't take long for the word to spread. "People at work knew by the time I got back," said Crump. "Word travels fast in a small town," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We join Mr. Crump's friends and neighbors in congratulating him, and we hope his winnings will help make this holiday season extra-special for him and his family."

Crump claimed the third of four top prizes offered in the Monthly Bonus, game number 839. Odds of winning any prize are one in 3.80, including break-even prizes. For selling the winning ticket, the Elkins Cut Rate is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $96 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
