HOUSTON MAN HAS LUCKY WEEKEND, GAINS $1 MILLION AND BABY DAUGHTER
(AUSTIN) ­ The birth of a daughter can make any dad feel lucky, but not all go on to win the lottery. Anthony W. Dill of Houston witnessed the birth of his baby girl on Saturday and then won $1 million. After purchasing three different instant tickets at a store near the hospital, Dill sat in his car with his mother and scratched his way to the $1 million top prize in the Texas $50 Million Club game. "I jumped out of the car about four feet high, and Mom thought I had won maybe $1,000," Dill explained. "Then I yelled at the top of my lungs, `One million dollars,' and as they say, the rest is history." With more than $51.4 million in prizes offered, the overall odds of winning any Texas $50 Million Club prize are one in 2.88, including breakeven prizes. Three top prizes remain unclaimed. "As the holidays approach, we know that Mr. Dill will have plenty to celebrate," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We congratulate him on his exceptionally lucky weekend." King Food Store # 2, 110 McClellan Road in Kingwood, will also benefit from Mr. Dill's good fortune. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $170 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
