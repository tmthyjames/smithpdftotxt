VETERAN'S GRANDDAUGHTER WINS $20,000 VETERANS CASH PRIZE FOR THE NEW YEAR
(Austin) ­ Kyle resident Jennifer Guerra and her family gather every November to honor her grandfather, a veteran who served in Vietnam. The tradition provides a compelling context for the $20,000 prize she claimed from the Veterans Cash scratch-off game today.

Introduced shortly before Veterans Day in November 2009, the Veterans Cash scratch-off is the first of its kind, benefitting the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. The fund was established by the Texas Legislature in 2005 to support local and statewide veterans' programs, and it is administered by the Texas Veterans Commission.

"Players like Ms. Guerra have made the Veterans Cash game a success. In less than two months, six top prizes of $20,000 each were awarded," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We are proud to have a role in providing revenue to the Fund for Veterans' Assistance and look forward to supporting the Texas Veterans Commission as they strive to improve veterans' services in the state."

Guerra won her prize after purchasing a single Veterans Cash ticket at the Mets Mart located at 2800 W. William Cannon Drive in Austin. Three top prizes of $20,000 remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 4.72, including break-even prizes. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $37 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $29 million. (more)
