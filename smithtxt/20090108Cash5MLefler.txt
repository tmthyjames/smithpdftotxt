AUSTIN WOMAN CLAIMS CASH FIVE® PRIZE, RECEIVES TWICE WHAT SHE EXPECTS
(AUSTIN) ­When Austin resident Mary Lefler checked her Cash Five® ticket and realized her numbers matched, she was ecstatic. Then she arrived at Texas Lottery® headquarters and got another nice surprise. Rather than the $6,000 or so she expected, Lefler received $12,971. Because two tickets matched the January 6 numbers (15 ­ 32 ­ 33 ­ 34 ­ 37), Lefler assumed that she would only receive half of the posted prize. She didn't realize the number had already been adjusted to reflect the individual prize amounts won. "We were already excited," she said. "I left work even."

prizes. Because her husband is a fan of the game, the Leflers play Cash Five regularly, and they already know how they'll use the money. "We'll pay some bills," said Lefler. According to Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief, "Many players look for common-sense uses for their winnings, and the Leflers are no exception. It's not surprising that such practical players enjoy Cash Five, which offers improved odds and six chances to win each week." Lefler purchased her winning ticket from Sahi Brothers Inc., located at 409 Louis Henna Boulevard in Round Rock. The Valero Corner Store #2302, 8303 Wilcrest in Houston, sold the other top-prize winning ticket from Tuesday night's drawing. Cash Five drawings are held nightly Monday through Saturday and feature overall odds of one in eight. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $8 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
