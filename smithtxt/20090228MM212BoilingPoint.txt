MEGA MILLIONS® REACHES THE BOILING POINT
(AUSTIN) ­ In science and chemistry classrooms across Texas, students learn the boiling point of water, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Perhaps it is only fitting that the Mega Millions® game, which helps the Texas Lottery Commission produce earnings for the Foundation School Fund (FSF), will hit its own boiling point. Because no tickets matched all of the numbers selected last night, the estimated jackpot for Tuesday's drawing will be $212 million. "Tuesday's estimated jackpot is not only the largest of 2009 thus far, it is the highest jackpot we've seen in over a year," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. The last time the Mega Millions jackpot topped $210 million was in February 2008, when a jackpot worth $275 million was claimed by a player from Georgia. The highest-ever Mega Millions jackpot was $390 million from the drawing held on March 6, 2007. Winners from Georgia and New Jersey shared that prize. "We are excited about this substantial jackpot and remind our players to try the Megaplier add-on feature for a chance to boost their non-jackpot winnings by two, three or four times," said Grief.
