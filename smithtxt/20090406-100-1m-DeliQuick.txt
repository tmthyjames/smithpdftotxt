$100,000 AND $1 MILLION PRIZES WON IN NORTH TEXAS; SAME RETAILER SELLS BOTH TICKETS
(AUSTIN) ­ On Tuesday of last week, Freddie E. Ramsey of Anna claimed a $100,000 top prize in the Precious Jewels instant game. Then on Friday, Richard E. Roberts Jr. of Decatur claimed the fourth of five $1 million prizes in the Texas $50 Million Club scratch-off game. These two winners have more in common than mere geography. Both players purchased their tickets at the Deli-Quick, Inc. located at 6500 E. Highway 380 in Cross Roads. In fact, the store is now eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the ticket worth $1 million. Store manager Peggy Morris congratulated the winners saying, "It is our great excitement and pleasure to be able to give deserved recognition to our loyal customers, and to have a $100,000 winner and a $1 million winner in the Cross Roads area." A construction supervisor, Ramsey travels all over North Texas, and will often pick up a lottery ticket when he stops for gas or coffee on his way to a job site. He has won several prizes, up to $10,000, in the past and says, "They know me where I claim my tickets down there in Fort Worth." Still, he doesn't have a special formula for winning. According to Ramsey, "I just pick at random, whatever jumps out at me."

Despite his care-free playing style, Ramsey is more reserved in spending his winnings. He is donating portions of the prize to charities in Dallas and Denver. "If I couldn't tell somebody and share this, it would be a waste," he says. "I have a good job and everything I need. I wanted to do some good." "Having two winners in one week who patronized the same store is certainly an interesting coincidence, but Mr. Ramsey's commendable plans make this win particularly special," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. Both prizes were claimed at the Fort Worth Claim Center. Due to a change in Texas Lottery® rules last June, all regional claim centers can award prizes up to $1 million. Prizes of more than $1 million and annuities must be claimed at the headquarters in Austin. Ramsey says he will continue to play Texas Lottery scratch-off games. "If you don't play, you can't win," he said, adding, "Next time, I hope I have to come to Austin to claim my prize." Roberts requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $65 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
