TRANSPLANTED COLORADAN RECEIVES WARM TEXAS WELCOME WITH MONTHLY BONUS WIN
(AUSTIN) ­ RDMON, L.P., by RDMON Management, L.L.C., General Partner Richard Montoya of Aubrey, President, claimed the final top prize in the Monthly Bonus game #839 at Texas Lottery® headquarters. Montoya recently moved to Texas from Colorado, and that decision paid off. Shortly after his move, he purchased a Monthly Bonus instant ticket which revealed the top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years, up to $2.4 million. After purchasing the ticket from a Texas Lottery self-service terminal at a Kroger in Denton, Montoya scratched the ticket in his truck. "At first, I didn't think I'd won," he said. "I kept comparing the little dollar sign." Once he was sure, Montoya called his wife and left such an excited message that she kept the recording of her husband yelling into the phone, "Hurry up! Call me! Call me!" Then he called his son. "I think he's thinking he wants a new car," laughed Montoya. As for living in the Lone Star State, he says, "Everything is just perfect here now." Montoya kept his ticket in a safe until he was ready to claim the fourth and final top prize in this release of Monthly Bonus. A new version of the same game is already available at many Texas Lottery retailers.
