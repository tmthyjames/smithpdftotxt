-CORRECTIONNEW TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF GAME FEATURES HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN PRIZES
(AUSTIN) ­ A new game is coming to Texas, and the word that best describes it is "BIG." With 10 top prizes of $2.5 million and 40 second-tier prizes of $1 million, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster features more $1 millionplus prizes than any other Texas Lottery® scratch-off game ever offered. "We always notice a sense of excitement surrounding our new games, but this game is particularly impressive," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Not only does it have the potential to create 50 new winners of $1 million or more, it will also help us in our mission to generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund and support Texas education." The $500,000,000 Blockbuster game starts Monday, May 18, and features total prizes exceeding half a billion dollars. More than one million of the prizes offered range from $100 to $500. Overall odds are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. Since the first ticket was sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery Commission has transferred more than $16 billion in revenue to the state. From 1992 to 1997, proceeds were allocated to the General Revenue Fund. Since a change in law in 1997, all net revenue, well over $11 billion, has been transferred to the FSF to support education in the state.
