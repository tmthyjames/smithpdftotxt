TEXAS LOTTERY® CELEBRATES 17TH BIRTHDAY WITH FOUR WINNERS OF $1 MILLION OR MORE
(AUSTIN) ­ On this day in 1992, the Texas Lottery Commission sold its first lottery ticket, but the agency isn't alone in celebrating this week. Although Monday was a holiday, four days allowed time for four Texans to claim Texas Lottery® prizes of $1 million or more. Two scratch-off games paid out top prizes this week. On Tuesday, Cynthia A. Wells of Pearland collected the Monthly Bonus top prize of $10,000 per month for 20 years, not to exceed $2.4 million. Then the Mesquite-based Martinez Perante Living Trust, Benito G. Lozano, trustee, claimed a $5 million prize in the $130,000,000 Platinum Payout, on Thursday. On Tuesday, two second-tier prizes of $1million each were awarded. Jeffrey A. Fugitt of Cedar Park claimed the second of 40 prizes of $1 million in the newly-introduced $500,000,000 Blockbuster instant game. That game also features 10 top prizes of $2.5 million, all of which remain unclaimed. Bridge City resident Dennis Moore Jr. won big as well, thanks to his decision to Megaply® his ticket. Because the Megaplier® `four' was selected before the drawing on May 19, his $250,000 Mega Millions® second-tier prize became $1 million.

"This has been an exciting week for our players and the agency, as we commemorate our 17th `birthday,'" said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "With the help of our outstanding network of retailers, we have paid out more than $31 billion in total prizes since May 29, 1992, and that is truly something worth celebrating." The Texas Lottery has also contributed a total of more than $16 billion in revenue to the state. From 1992 to 1997, proceeds were allocated to the General Revenue Fund. Since a change in law in 1997, all net revenue has been transferred to the Foundation School Fund (FSF) to support education in the state. Total contributions to the FSF currently exceed $11 billion. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
