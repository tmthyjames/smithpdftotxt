JOURDANTON RESIDENT SCRATCHES FOR THE FIRST TIME AND RECEIVES $10,000 BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM THE $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER TICKET
(AUSTIN) ­ You might call it beginner's luck or a birthday surprise. Jourdanton resident Johan Dinkelmann decided to play a Texas Lottery® scratch-off game for the first time on his birthday, and his decision eventually led him to claim a $10,000 prize at the Texas Lottery Claim Center in San Antonio. "It was a great time to start," said Dinkelmann. "I purchased a ticket and won $50, and with those winnings, purchased another one and won $10,000 on that ticket."

dollars in total prizes. Ten top prizes of $2,500,000 and 38 prizes of $1,000,000 remain unclaimed in the game. "When we introduced the $500,000,000 Blockbuster, we knew it would be big," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Still, no one could have predicted that one of our newest players would win so quickly, and on his birthday, too. Mr. Dinkelmann certainly has plenty to celebrate." The prize-winning ticket came from the Pico #14 located at 1202 Oak in Jourdanton. According to Dinkelmann, "I purchased it on my birthday, and what a lucky day it was!" Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $17 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million.
