(AUSTIN) ­ It wasn't long after his birthday that Houston resident Mario Longoria made a quick stop at a Valero Corner Store while on his way to pick up his daughter for the weekend. His decision ultimately rewarded him with a Weekly Bonus top prize. "I went into the store for some water. While I was there, I thought, `Let me get one ticket,' and I got the Weekly Bonus," said Longoria. After checking the winning number, he scratched the row of numbers to the right. "I got a matching number 14, but I had never scratched the amount. Then I scratched the prize and saw the $500 a week," he explained. "That's a good birthday present." Longoria claimed the second top prize in the $1 instant game, and three top prizes remain unclaimed. The Weekly Bonus scratch-off ticket features more than $18.2 million in total prizes, with a top prize of $500 a week for 20 years, not to exceed $520,000.

Then I'll see what else I want to do." The Valero Corner Store #2648, located at 10302 Interstate Highway 10 Service Road in Jacinto City, sold Longoria the winning ticket. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $57 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $16 million.
