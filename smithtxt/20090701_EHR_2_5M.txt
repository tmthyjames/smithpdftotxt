SCRATCH-OFF PLAYERS FOLLOW ELEPHANT TO $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER PRIZE OF $2.5 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ The $500,000,000 Blockbuster game awarded its first $2.5 million top prize today, and the winners say they have the new spokesperson to thank for it. San Antonio-based EHR, LLC, through its authorized representative member Richard W. Jones, Trustee, claimed the prize. However, group members say they might not have played if it weren't for the jumbo spokesperson. The elephant featured in the television advertisements captured their attention and had them watching for the introduction of the new scratch-off game. Shortly after the game was introduced, one member purchased a ticket at a Murphy USA. When she saw the ticket might be a winner, she tried unsuccessfully to get another group member to check the ticket. Then she attempted to get a neighbor's opinion, but the neighbor wasn't home. She and the other group member took the following day off from work to contact Texas Lottery® headquarters about their prize. Ultimately, they were able to travel to Austin as a group and claimed their winnings today. Asked about their plans for the money, one member answered, "We want to pay off our mortgage and student loans."
