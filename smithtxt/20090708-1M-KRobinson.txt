(AUSTIN) ­ The Robinson 2009 Trust represented by Houston resident Kibby Robinson, Trustee, claimed the first of four top prizes in the Weekly Grand instant game. Robinson says he's played Weekly Grand off and on for about 10 years and consistently the last eight. That loyalty paid off in a win worth $1,040,000. His winning system is simple. "I buy two Break the Bank and two Weekly Grand each week." The purchase was so routine he didn't bother to check his Texas Lottery® scratch-off right away. "I had it in my pocket and forgot about it," said Robinson. When he finally scratched the Weekly Grand ticket, he could hardly believe what he saw ­ a top prize of $1,000 per week for 20 years. "I almost fainted, almost cried, too." Robinson knew right away how the money would be used. "I plan on sending my son to college," he said.
