LONGVIEW RESIDENT VOWS TO MEGAPLY® AND WINS $40,000 MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Tonia Snoddy of Longview says she learned to Megaply® the hard way last year, by missing a chance to multiply a Mega Millions® prize worth $150 by two, three or four times. She vowed never to lose out on the extra prize money again. On Friday, July 17, she bought her Mega Millions ticket, and her decision to Megaply quadrupled her $10,000 non-jackpot prize to a total prize of $40,000. "After watching TV Sunday night, I checked the numbers, and they looked familiar," said Snoddy. The ticket, however, was in the glove compartment of her car, and she decided to check it on Monday. "On my lunch break at work, I got that ticket and checked it on the computer. Then I went to the gas station across the street and asked them to check it. The machine made all this noise, but the man said he couldn't tell me how much I'd won. He said I'd have to go to the office," she explained. "So, I called the 800-number on the ticket, and when the lady there said it was $40,000, I almost fainted." Once she recovered from the shock, Snoddy rushed to the Tyler Claim Center to claim her prize. "I pulled my boss out of a meeting and told him," she said. "I had to leave work to come over here."

Due to the timing of the win, Snoddy had no trouble deciding how to use the money. "I've got bills and a teenage son who needs school clothes and supplies. This is just perfect." The winning numbers for the July 17 drawing were 8 ­ 17 ­ 40 ­ 47 ­ 50 and the Mega Ball 13. Snoddy matched four of the five numbers, plus the Mega Ball. "For just one dollar more per playboard, Mega Millions players in Texas have the opportunity to increase their non-jackpot winnings by two, three or four times with the Megaplier add-on feature," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "It certainly worked out for Ms. Snoddy, who'll be able to buy plenty of school supplies with her $40,000 prize." She says her winning strategy is simple, "Just keep hope alive." The winning ticket was purchased at the Pine Tree Food Mart, 1000 Pine Tree Road in Longview. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $37 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $26 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
