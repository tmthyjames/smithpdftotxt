VICTORIA RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION TEXAS LOTTERY® PRIZE, QUESTIONS OWN EYESIGHT
(AUSTIN) ­ Wednesday was just another day at work for Darryl Heller of Victoria until he decided to try a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket from the Texas Lottery®. His decision eventually led him to a second-tier prize and questions about his ability to see. "I purchased this ticket at my store and scratched only the numbers off to see if I matched a winning number. When I'd seen I matched the `16', I got a little excited but did not scratch off the dollar amount," said Heller. About that time, Heller became distracted by his work duties, and it took a little while for his focus to return to his winning ticket. "I remembered I had not scratched to see how much I had won," he explained. "When I scratched the $1 million prize amount, I could not believe my eyes. I got real close to my ticket to make sure I was seeing it right."

Luckily, his eyes were just fine. His ticket showed a $1 million second-tier prize in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game. "I play the bigger tickets," said Heller. "It seems like they pay higher prizes, but I didn't think I'd ever win this much." For selling the winning ticket, B & D's General Store, located at 9765 US Highway 87 North in Victoria, is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus. "Winning a significant prize, as Mr. Heller did, could shock anyone, but thanks to retail stores like his, Texas education remains the big winner," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "With the help of our retailers, we have been able to contribute more than $11 billion to the Foundation School Fund since 1997." The $500,000,000 Blockbuster was introduced in May, and Heller is the eighth winner to claim a prize of $1 million or more in the game. Nine top prizes of $2.5 million and 33 second-tier prizes of $1 million each remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any $500,000,000 Blockbuster prize are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. Heller plans to pay some bills with his prize money. As a fan of scratch-off tickets, Lotto Texas® and Mega Millions®, he says he'll keep playing, hoping to win more prizes in the future. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $31 million.
