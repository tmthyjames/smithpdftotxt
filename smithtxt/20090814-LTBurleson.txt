AFTER THREE MONTHS, WINNING LOTTO TEXAS® TICKET PURCHASED IN BURLESON STILL A MYSTERY
(AUSTIN) ­ More than halfway through the 180-day claim period, Texas Lottery® officials are still waiting to hear from a Lotto Texas® jackpot winner who purchased a ticket in Burleson. "We know that someone purchased a winning ticket for the Lotto Texas drawing on May 6, but we haven't heard from the winner," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Everyone who purchased a ticket at the Big Country Mart should take this opportunity to check those tickets. There may be a prize worth more than $7 million waiting for you in Austin." Burleson's Big Country Mart, located at 4624 Highway 1187, sold the winning ticket, and the winning numbers selected by the player were 4 ­ 14 ­ 21 ­ 29 ­ 34 ­ 43. Although the Lotto Texas drawing held on May 6 had an estimated annuitized jackpot of $11 million, the player chose the Cash Value Option worth $7,131,735.60. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $146 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $37 million. This is the highest Lotto Texas jackpot amount since April 2007.
