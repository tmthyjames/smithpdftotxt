PANHANDLE RESIDENT CLAIMS FINAL $100,000 TOP PRIZE IN PRECIOUS JEWELS SCRATCH-OFF GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ With only one top prize remaining in the Precious Jewels game, Blanca E. Martinez of Dumas claimed $100,000 at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Amarillo. "I went grocery shopping at the United and bought several tickets at the machine," Martinez explained. She took the tickets home and scratched them, eventually revealing the $100,000 prize. "I told my husband, daughter and son-in-law," said Martinez. "They didn't want to believe me. They were jumping around the house and saying, `Let me see it.'" It was true. Martinez held a ticket worth $100,000, and she already knew how to spend the money. "We're going car shopping," said Martinez, adding that she'll continue to play her favorite Texas Lottery scratch-offs.

"With more than $29 million in total prizes and four winners of $100,000, Precious Jewels has been a fun and entertaining game for our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief.

Martinez purchased her winning ticket at the United Supermarket #542 located at 1420 Guylane Plaza in Dumas. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $170 million.
