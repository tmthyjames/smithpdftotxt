$500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER AWARDS SECOND TOP PRIZE OF $2.5 MILLION, MILLIONS MORE TO CLAIM
(AUSTIN) ­ Last week's top-selling Texas Lottery® scratch-off, $500,000,000 Blockbuster, awarded its second top prize of $2.5 million to Craig M Badger of Keller. He purchased his ticket at the 7-Eleven #34013, located at 8616 Davis Blvd. in North Richland Hills, and the store is eligible to receive a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket. With eight top prizes of $2.5 million and 32 second-tier prizes of $1 million still unclaimed, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster still has plenty to offer players, but it's not the only game with impressive prizes. Monday's Texas Two Step® advertised jackpot is $1.2 million. The Lotto Texas® jackpot climbed to an estimated $43 million for Saturday's drawing. Since no one won the Mega Millions® jackpot prize on Tuesday, tonight's estimated jackpot will be $333 million. "It's been about two years since we've seen Lotto Texas and Mega Millions jackpots at this level," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This week, players have the chance to win big no matter which of these games they most enjoy." Mr. Badger requested minimal publicity.
