SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT WINS FIRST $100,000 PRIZE FROM HOUSTON TEXANS TICKET, PLANS TO ENTER DALLAS COWBOYS SECOND-CHANCE DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ Joe Zamora of San Antonio is a football fan, and he likes his Texas teams. He purchased his Mega Millions® and Lotto Texas® tickets at the HEB Food Store #379, 400 Valley Hi Drive in San Antonio, and something told him he should also buy both the Houston Texans and the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off games. "I like to watch football," he said. "I don't know why I bought them both. I just felt like it would be a winner." He was right. Zamora scratched the tickets during his lunch break, and the Houston Texans ticket revealed a $100,000 prize, making him the first top-prize winner for that game. Although he's won as much as $100 in the past, he could hardly believe his eyes. "It still hasn't kicked in," said Zamora. He wasn't the only one shocked by the prize. His wife refused to believe he'd won, at first. "I called her at work and asked her if she could talk," he explained. "I told her I won, and she said, `No, you're lying.'" Eventually, he persuaded her to accompany him to the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in San Antonio, where he claimed his prize.

Zamora had less luck with his Dallas Cowboys ticket, but he plans to send that one in for the second-chance drawing. "The Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys tickets have already been a hit with many of our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "By entering the second-chance drawings, our players get an opportunity to turn non-winning tickets into team merchandise or once-in-a-lifetime trips perfect for football fans." Both the Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys games offer cash prizes up to $100,000 and second-chance drawings for additional prizes. Players can fill out the backs of their non-winning tickets and mail them in for a chance to win in the drawings to be held throughout football season. Tonight's advertised jackpot for Texas Two Step® is $1.2 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million.
