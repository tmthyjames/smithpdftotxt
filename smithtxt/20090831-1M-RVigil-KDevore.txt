TWO PLAYERS CLAIM $1 MILLION SECOND PRIZES
(AUSTIN) ­ Mega Millions players in Texas don't need to hit the jackpot to win a significant prize. For an additional $1 per playboard, players can Megaply® their non-jackpot winning by two, three or four times. That's what Ronald Vigil of Bastrop and Kanokphorn Devore of Dallas did, and it raised their $250,000 prizes to $1 million each for the Mega Millions drawing held August 25. They matched all five numbers drawn (3 ­ 12 ­ 19 ­ 22 ­ 40), but missed the Mega Ball (2). Because the Megaplier® four was chosen, the second-tier tickets became $1 million winners. Vigil purchased his ticket at the Sac N Pac #406, located at 1525 Highway 71 West in Cedar Creek, and Devore's ticket came from a selfservice terminal at the Kroger #587, 3939 Frankford Road in Dallas. Both claimants requested minimal publicity. Tonight's advertised jackpot for Texas Two Step® is $1.2 million. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org. ...
