CASH FIVE® PLAYER TAKES A BREAK FROM PLAYING, THEN RETURNS IN TIME TO WIN $24,662 TOP PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ Only one ticket matched all five numbers for Friday's Cash Five® drawing. The numbers were 2 ­ 8 ­ 19 ­ 29 ­ 36, and the ticket, worth $24,662, belonged to Fidela Villarreal of Victoria. She had a rather halting journey to the win, however. "I used to play Cash Five on a regular basis, and then I stopped playing for a while," explained Villarreal. "In May of this year, I started playing again." Cycling through Texas Lottery® games depending on her wins, Villarreal has also enjoyed Pick 3® and scratch-off games in the past. Her system is simple if she's not winning on one game, she moves on to another. "I like Cash Five," she said. "I've won with four numbers before. I never think big. If I get $2, I'm happy."

She buys her Quick Pick tickets on the way to work, and then checks the news at night to see whether her numbers came up. This weekend, she got quite a surprise and needed extra confirmation. "I watched the news to get the numbers, but I did not get the last number before the numbers went off the TV screen. I asked my son to get the paper for me Saturday morning," she explained. "I could not believe I hit all five numbers." Monday morning, Villarreal again made a stop on her way to work, but instead of buying tickets, she claimed her prize at the Texas Lottery Claim Center in Victoria. "Cash Five continues to attract a loyal following," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "With overall odds of one in eight and nightly drawings Monday through Saturday, it's no wonder that players like Ms. Villarreal come back to that game again and again." Villarreal purchased her Cash Five ticket at the Speedy Stop Food Store #1, 8701 N. Navarro in Victoria. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a retailer bonus of $246.62. Tonight's advertised jackpot for Texas Two Step® is $1.2 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $45 million.
