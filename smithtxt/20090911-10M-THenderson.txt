PLAYER CLAIMS FIRST-EVER $10 MILLION SCRATCHOFF PRIZE FROM THE $140,000,000 EXTREME PAYOUT
(AUSTIN) ­ Today, for the first time ever, a Texas Lottery® player claimed a $10 million prize from a scratch-off ticket. Tracy Lynn Henderson of Pasadena won the top prize in the $140,000,000 Extreme Payout. "I play it a little bit, not too much," said Henderson. "It's got the higher percentage on the payout. You could buy two or three $20 tickets or one $50." In fact, the $140,000,000 Extreme Payout features the highest prize payout of any current Texas Lottery instant game in addition to having the highest top prize. Overall odds are one in 2.61, including break-even prizes. Henderson explained, "I play every once in a while. I'll buy one or two, and if I don't win, then I don't play for a while." This time, he'd just gotten home from work when he decided to scratch the ticket. When he saw the top prize, he called his wife in to look at it, but did so with a warning. He told her, "This is a big winner so don't rip it or yank it." The ticket remained intact, and Henderson travelled to Texas Lottery Headquarters in Austin to claim his prize. For him, the next step is obvious. "I'll invest it wisely."

"With the chance to win more than $140 million in prizes, it's no wonder the $140,000,000 Extreme Payout has become popular among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. For selling the winning ticket, the Superior K Food Store located at 4739 Strawberry Road is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $28 million. Tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $51 million.
