AGREEMENT MAY BRING POWERBALL® TO TEXAS
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission announced today that an agreement in principle has been reached between the Mega Millions® consortium and the Multi-State Lottery Association to allow for the sale of both Mega Millions and Powerball® tickets in all U.S. lottery jurisdictions. Texas is a member of Mega Millions, which is currently offered in 12 states. Powerball is currently available in 33 other lotteries (31 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands). "This agreement is the result of several joint meetings that Texas has participated in to discuss the potential of selling both Mega Millions and Powerball in all U.S. lotteries," said Texas Lottery Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "While we are pleased that an agreement has been reached, there is still much work to be done and any projection of additional revenue that Texas may realize from the sale of Powerball tickets would be premature at this time." "However, allowing state lotteries to sell both Powerball and Mega Millions will obviously create more winners and generate incremental growth in revenue for the good causes that lotteries are established to support, such as the Foundation School Fund here in Texas," Grief said. State law in Texas allows the Texas Lottery to join more than one multi-jurisdictional game. No firm date has been set for the introduction of Powerball in Texas, although it is hoped that it could be in early 2010.
