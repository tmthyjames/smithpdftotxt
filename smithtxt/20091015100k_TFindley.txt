DALLAS COWBOYS FAN SHEDS TEARS OF JOY AFTER REVEALING $100,000 INSTANT PRIZE
(Austin) ­ An occasional Texas Lottery® player and a full-time Dallas Cowboys fan, Tammy Findley of Rio Vista says it was "a wonderful surprise" when the Dallas Cowboys ticket she bought this morning revealed the $100,000 top prize. "I am a big Cowboys fan," said Findley. "I bought it on my way to work, put it in my purse and forgot about it." When she finally remembered to scratch the ticket, she couldn't believe her eyes. Findley checked the instructions and looked at the ticket again. "When I saw what I had, my knees buckled, and I started crying and called my husband," she said. "I have never been so excited in my life, except when my kids and grandchildren were born." She says she'll continue playing the game and hopes to win an autographed jersey in one of the second-chance drawings.

"From instant cash prizes to exciting second-chance prizes, this game has a little something for everyone," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "No wonder it has been a success and helped us in our mission to generate revenue for the Foundation School Fund to support Texas education." Still in shock, Findley speculated that she might use the money to buy a new car and provide her grandchildren with a nice Christmas. The River Run Texaco located at 100 N. Highway 174 in Rio Vista sold Findley her winning Dallas Cowboys ticket. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is worth an estimated $200 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $73 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Web site at http://www.txlottery.org.
