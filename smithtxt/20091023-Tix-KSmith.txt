AFTER SEASON TICKETS WIN, COUPLE HOPES TO WIN "AWAY GAME TRIP" PACKAGE NEXT
(Austin) ­ Kenny Smith and his wife are sports fans and scratch-off players. It only made sense that they would enjoy the Dallas Cowboys instant game from the Texas Lottery®. The Boyd residents say they have played the game since it came out, sending in each non-winning ticket for the second-chance drawings. Their efforts paid off when they won a pair of Dallas Cowboys 2010 Season Tickets.

"We're fans, me and my wife, and she says half those tickets are hers," said Smith.

The couple won their season tickets in the second of five second-chance drawings to be held in the Dallas Cowboys game. Players who wish to enter the drawings can fill out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affix a first-class stamp and place the ticket in the mail.

Smith says he's doing just that.

"I'm ready for the next drawing. I hope I'll get to go to New York to see them play the Giants," he said, referring to the "Away Game Trip" for two offered as a second-chance prize.

"From Arlington to the Meadowlands, there is no wrong way to enjoy a Dallas Cowboys game," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We congratulate Mr. Smith on his win and wish him luck in the next drawing, coming up November 17."
