DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKET WINNER FROM EL PASO LOOKS FORWARD TO FALL 2010
(Austin) ­ El Paso resident Jesse Alvarez is already making plans for next fall after winning 2010 season tickets to see the Dallas Cowboys play in their new stadium.

"Since I was a little kid, I've watched the Cowboys with my dad," he said. "I've been a fan, but I'm even more so now."

Having won one of 20 pairs of season tickets awarded in the most recent Dallas Cowboys secondchance drawing, he'll be sitting between the 30-yard lines next year.

"I didn't believe it at first," said Alvarez. "I've never won anything big like that."

Three additional drawings will be held to award hundreds more Dallas Cowboys second-chance prizes. In addition to 2010 season tickets, Dallas Cowboys gift cards, authentic autographed jerseys and exciting experiential trip packages will be awarded. Texas Lottery® players can enter by filling out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys instant ticket, affixing a first-class stamp, and putting the ticket in the mail. The next drawing is scheduled for November 17.
