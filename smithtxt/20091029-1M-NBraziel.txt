SECOND MERRY MILLIONAIRE TOP PRIZE CLAIMED

(Austin) ­ Lorena resident Nola Braziel claimed the second of three $1 million top prizes in the Texas Lottery® scratchoff game, Merry Millionaire. She purchased her ticket from the Troy Exxon located at 4 N. Central Ave. in Troy. The store is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket.

The $20 Merry Millionaire ticket was introduced earlier this month as part of the Texas Lottery's suite of holiday scratchoffs. Other seasonal games include Happy Holidays, Jingle Jumbo Bucks, Snow Dough, Sparkling 7's, Stocking Stuffer and Winter Winnings.

"Each year, we work to develop fun and exciting holidaythemed games for our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This holiday season, as always, we encourage our customers to enjoy Texas Lottery games responsibly. It only takes one ticket to win, and players must be at least 18 years old to purchase a ticket."
