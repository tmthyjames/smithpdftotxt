PAIR OF DALLAS COWBOYS 2010 SEASON TICKETS AWARDED TO LONG-TERM FAN FROM BROOKSHIRE
(Austin) ­ A Dallas Cowboys fan for more than 40 years, Barbara Repka of Brookshire was naturally attracted to the new Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®.

"I saw the Dallas Cowboys had a new scratch-off, so I purchased four," said Repka. "I didn't win, so I mailed them for a second chance."

When she was notified, Repka couldn't believe she'd won a pair of Dallas Cowboys 2010 season tickets. She thought it was a prank at first.

"It's no wonder that a 40-year fan might be shocked to hear she's won a pair of Dallas Cowboys season tickets, but this was no prank," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "The next second-chance drawing will be held on November 17, and 20 more pairs of season tickets will be awarded in that drawing."

Repka is already making plans for next year, saying, "I can't wait until 2010. Go Cowboys!"

Other second-chance prizes include Dallas Cowboys merchandise and gift certificates, awaygame trips, draft weekend packages and "Wild Weekend" packages that allow the winner and 19 guests to enjoy a VIP trip to a Dallas Cowboys home game. Players can enter the drawings by filling out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affixing a first-class stamp, and putting the ticket in the mail.
