EL PASOAN WINS TOP PRIZE IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER GAME FROM THE TEXAS LOTTERY®

(AUSTIN) ­Bobby L. Bowens of El Paso today claimed the top prize of $2.5 million in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. Bowens purchased one ticket at the Big Diamond #1273, 11680 Montwood in El Paso. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this ticket. "The $500,000,000 Blockbuster game has such a wide variety of significant prizes that it has proven to be really popular among our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Today's winner claimed only the third of the 10 top prizes of $2.5 million. There are also 29 prizes of $1 million that remain unclaimed, as well as many more exciting lower-tier prizes." Bowens requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $63 million, and tomorrow's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $8 million.
