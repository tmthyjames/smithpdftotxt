DALLAS TRIP LEADS CEDAR PARK RESIDENT STRAIGHT TO $20,000 MONEY TREE TOP PRIZE
(Austin) ­ Paula Harper of Cedar Park was in the Dallas area to visit her father when she stopped at the Fiesta Mart #59, 1200 E. Parker Road in Plano. There, she randomly picked out a $2 Money Tree ticket and scratched her way to a $20,000 prize.

"I scratched it right there in the store, but it took a while to sink in. I kept looking at the ticket like, `Are you sure?'" said Harper. "It took most of the night for me to believe it." She brought her ticket and her father to the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Austin to retrieve her winnings. While there, she and her father scratched a few more tickets, for good measure.

"If you don't try, you can't win," she said. "You have to play to have a chance."

This is the seventh of eight $20,000 top prizes to be awarded in the Money Tree game, which features more than $10 million in total prizes. Overall odds to win any prize are one in 4.39, including break-even prizes.

Harper says she got her winning ticket at the perfect time, and she will use the prize money to help her family.

"Many of our players talk about the importance of family, and Ms. Harper is no exception," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Perhaps, this winning ticket will give her family one more thing to celebrate during the holiday season." (more)
