DALLAS COWBOYS FAN FROM WYLIE WINS 2010 SEASON TICKETS IN 2ND-CHANCE DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­The last two years have been stressful for Carol Myrick and her family for a variety of reasons, so winning 2010 Dallas Cowboys season tickets provided the big relief they needed. Myrick is an emergency room nurse. Her shifts are 12 to 13 hours long most days. Despite the intensity of her job, she considers it a blessing to work where she does, but letting go of her day isn't always easy. "I can hardly say how happy it made me that day when I came home from work and my husband said, `The Lottery called. It's about the Cowboys tickets,'" Myrick said. "He was more excited than I was. This is such a huge thing for us. We've seen a lot of the Cowboy greats who have come and gone. Also, all the men in the family are now trying to be my best friend. Some of them even have Cowboy bobble-head dolls. We're fans." Myrick said she's going to "spread the wealth" of these tickets in the family, ensuring that different members get to share in the excitement of seeing the Cowboys play in the stadium. One ticket, however, is reserved for someone very special. "My nephew will be returning from Iraq right before Christmas 2010," Myrick said. "Winning these tickets has put a big smile on the faces of my family members. We've been going to the Cowboys games since I was in my early teens, so we all know what this means; we're going to Jerry's House. Thank you Texas Lottery and thank you Dallas Cowboys!" "Wylie is right around the corner, so to speak, from the Cowboys' new stadium, which will make getting to the home games of the 2010 season easy for Ms. Myrick and her family," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "Like so many people in Texas, Ms. Myrick grew up watching the Cowboys, and being able to watch the games in person will be all the more special for her and her family." The top cash prize in the Dallas Cowboys game is $100,000. To date, seven of the 13 prizes of $100,000 have been claimed. The next second-chance drawing for the Dallas Cowboys game is scheduled for December 15. Players who wish to enter the drawings can fill out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affix a first-class stamp and place the ticket in the mail.
