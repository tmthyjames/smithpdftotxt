A DALLAS COWBOYS TICKET AND A STAMP LEAD CARROLLTON FAN TO 2010 SEASON TICKETS
(Austin) ­ "My 28-cent stamp and a non-winning Dallas Cowboys scratcher ticket won me 2010 Dallas Cowboys season tickets inside the 30-yard line," said John Wesley Schmidt of Carrollton.

Schmidt entered the third Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing and won one of 20 pairs of season tickets awarded in that drawing.

After receiving word of his win, Schmidt said, "See ya there, Mr. Jerry Jones! Cowboys, Super Bowl champs again in 2010!"

The next drawing will be held December 15, with hundreds of second-chance prizes including Dallas Cowboys merchandise and once-in-a-lifetime experiential prizes. Texas Lottery® players who wish to enter can fill out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys ticket, affix a firstclass stamp and mail.

"With more than $38 million in cash prizes and some fantastic second-chance prizes, the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game has captured the attention of many of our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's no surprise that Mr. Schmidt would be excited about winning. After all, what could be better for a Dallas Cowboys fan than tickets to all the home games?"

Six top prizes of $100,000 each remain unclaimed in the Dallas Cowboys game. Overall odds of winning any cash prize are one in 3.85, including break-even prizes. (more)
