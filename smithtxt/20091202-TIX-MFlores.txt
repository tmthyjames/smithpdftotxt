SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT READY TO TRAVEL TO DALLAS FOR 2010 SEASON AT COWBOYS STADIUM
(Austin) ­ At first, Maricruz Flores of San Antonio thought someone was trying to fool her when she received notice that she'd won one of 20 pairs of Dallas Cowboys 2010 season tickets awarded in a recent Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing from the Texas Lottery®. It was no trick, though. Her name came up in the drawing, and she'll have seats at each of the home games.

"I bought a Dallas Cowboys scratch-off ticket, and it was not a winner. The following day, I put the stamp on the back and mailed it off. I completely forgot about it," explained Flores.

Flores says she will take her husband and other family members to the games. She is particularly excited about seeing the new stadium.

"I see it on TV every Sunday," she said. "It may take me all season to see the whole thing, but I'm looking forward to it."

"Some of our winners, like Mrs. Flores, seem as excited about the new stadium as they are about the games they'll see there," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "No doubt, she'll enjoy both from her season-ticket seats between the 30-yard lines."
