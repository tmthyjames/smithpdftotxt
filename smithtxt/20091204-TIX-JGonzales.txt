DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON TICKETS HAVEN'T FAZED COOL CUSTOMER FROM RED OAK, YET
(Austin) ­ Jason Gonzales of Red Oak is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys, a big fan. That's why friends and family were surprised when he reacted calmly after he won a pair of season tickets between the 30-yard lines for every game in Cowboys Stadium next season by entering a Dallas Cowboys second-chance drawing.

"Maybe when I have the tickets in my hand, maybe then it'll hit me," said Gonzales.

Gonzales plans to take his son with him to some of the games and may bring other family and friends along, too.

"Football has a rich history in this state, and the Dallas Cowboys are a big part of that," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "It is inspiring to see that Mr. Gonzales plans to use his win as an opportunity to share a Texas tradition with his son and other family members."

The $5 Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game offers more than $38 million in instant prizes. Six top prizes of $100,000 each remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any cash prize are one in 3.85, including break-even prizes.
