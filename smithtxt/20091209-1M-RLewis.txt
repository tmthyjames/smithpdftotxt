$500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER AWARDS 12TH PRIZE OF $1 MILLION JUST IN TIME FOR HOLIDAYS
(Austin) ­The holidays are fast approaching and Renée B. Lewis of Beaumont couldn't be happier about the timing of her win. She claimed the 12th prize of $1 million in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game today.

"I've been playing since it came out, sporadically. I was on my way home last night when I stopped at the store and decided to get one," she said. "I scratched it in my driveway and kept looking up-down-up-down. I had to be sure the numbers matched."

Lewis immediately took the ticket to her husband, and they started making plans together.

"It was a wonderful, wonderful feeling," she said. "I really slept well last night."

"With more than half a billion dollars in total prizes, the $500,000,000 Blockbuster probably has a lot of our players dreaming about what they could do if they won," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "For Mrs. Lewis, those dreams can come true. She claimed a $1 million prize, but seven top prizes of $2.5 million and 28 prizes worth $1 million each still remain unclaimed."
