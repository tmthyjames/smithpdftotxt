SCRATCH-OFF PLAYER FROM SAN ANTONIO WINS CUSTOM MOTORCYCLE IN LUCKY RIDER DRAWING
(Austin) ­ Motorcycle enthusiast Paul Hilton of San Antonio found a Texas Lottery® game perfect for him, and there was only one prize he hoped to win, the Lucky Rider pro-street bike designed by LDT Customs, Inc. He played the Lucky Rider game faithfully and mailed in each non-winning ticket for the second-chance drawings. His perseverance paid off when he received the call informing him of his win.

"I heard what they said, but I couldn't believe it," said Hilton. "I still can't believe I won."

Hilton claimed the second of three motorcycles to be awarded in second-chance drawings. The final drawing will be scheduled for a date after the end of the game. Players who wish to enter that drawing should fill out the back of their non-winning Lucky Rider ticket, affix a first-class stamp and mail.

Lucky Rider features more than $17 million in total prizes. Two instant-win bikes and two $50,000 cash prizes remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 3.70, including break-even prizes.
