TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM PLANO CLAIMS FINAL TOP PRIZE IN MERRY MILLIONAIRE GAME
(Austin) ­ Plano resident Jeremy McNamara claimed the third and final $1 million top prize in the Merry Millionaire scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. This is also the second top prize from this game to be awarded in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The first $1 million prize went to Patrick Holcomb, a school teacher from Arlington.

"We introduced the Merry Millionaire game in October so that it would be available to our players during the holiday season," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "No doubt the three $1 million prizes awarded since then have helped make this a cheerful winter for the winners."

The Speedmax #4 located at 301 Legacy Drive in Plano is eligible for a $10,000 retailer bonus for selling the winning ticket.

This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $26 million.
