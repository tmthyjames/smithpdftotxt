DALLAS COWBOYS FAN WINS 2010 SEASON TICKETS IN TEXAS LOTTERY® DRAWING
(Austin) ­ James Smith of Dallas has been a Dallas Cowboys fan from the beginning, so it was only natural that he would enjoy the Dallas Cowboys scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. He plays the game regularly and mails in his non-winning tickets for the second-chance drawings. Still, he wasn't quite prepared when he found out he won a pair of tickets for the Dallas Cowboys 2010 season.

"When the man from the lottery told me I won the Cowboys tickets, I could not speak for a few seconds," said Smith. "I went blank. I didn't realize I'd really done it ­ I won the tickets."

According to Smith, living in the Dallas area will make the games easy to attend, but he's not ready to quit winning just yet.

"I'm still putting tickets in. I want to win the big one," said Smith, referring to the Dallas Cowboys "Wild Weekend" Package. That prize includes a VIP trip for 20 to watch a game at the new Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

Players who wish to enter the drawing should fill out the back of each non-winning Dallas Cowboys instant ticket, affix a first-class stamp and mail.
