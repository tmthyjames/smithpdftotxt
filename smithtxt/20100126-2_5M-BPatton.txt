WINNER FROM PORTER BRINGS FAMILY TO AUSTIN AFTER FINDING TWO PRIZES IN ONE DAY
(Austin) ­ After driving more than 150 miles, Billy J Patton of Porter arrived at the Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin. He brought with him 11 family members and one $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket worth $2.5 million. His journey started Monday morning.

"I stopped at a store early in the morning and bought a ticket. I won $100 on that one. Then coming home I stopped at a store," said Patton. "I just had a gut feeling. I bought two $5 tickets and the one $20."

He scratched his tickets in the parking lot outside the Right Food Mart located at 22570 Ford Road in Porter. His last purchase revealed the top prize, but it took travelling to Austin for the reality of his win to set in.

"When we got here, I sat out in the parking lot and said, `It's true! I really won,'" Patton said.

This is the fourth top prize awarded in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster, which features more than half a billion dollars in total prizes. Six prizes of $2.5 million and 26 second-tier prizes worth $1 million each remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 2.77, including break-even prizes.

Patton's plans are clear. He hopes to use his winnings to help his family and his church. (more)
