MEGA MILLIONS® $144 MILLION JACKPOT WINNER
FROM KATY ENCOURAGES CHARITABLE GIVING
(Austin) ­ Despite claiming the largest prize in Texas Lottery® history, Katy resident William R Kiefer wants no part of fame or fortune. This humble Texan only has three plans: retire, donate to worthy causes and encourage others to do the same. "The greatest gift my parents gave me was to be raised a Christian," said Kiefer. "I plan to give 60 percent of all after-tax winnings to charity." Kiefer says he sees his win as an opportunity to set an example for others regarding his faith and raise awareness for worthy causes such as abused children, relief for Haiti and support for retired nuns. He does not, however, wish to promote himself. He said, "I will not provide any interviews except to the Texas Catholic Herald." Kiefer's Quick Pick ticket matched all five numbers (1 ­ 10 ­ 22 ­ 23 ­ 38) plus the Mega Ball (19) for the Mega Millions® drawing held Friday, January 29. He will receive 26 annual payments totaling $144 million. "We are proud to count Mr. Kiefer among our players. Many winners plan to give to charity, but I don't think we've ever seen generosity quite like this," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "This is also an opportunity to remind our players that Texans really do win the big jackpots. With games like Mega Millions and Powerball in Texas, we will continue to support Texas education through the Foundation School Fund."
