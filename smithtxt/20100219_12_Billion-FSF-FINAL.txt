TEXAS LOTTERY® SURPASSES $12 BILLION IN REVENUE TO FOUNDATION SCHOOL FUND
(Austin) ­With a transfer of $73.3 million on February 10, the Texas Lottery® has now exceeded $12 billion in total transfers to the Foundation School Fund (FSF) since 1997.

"Thanks to the efforts of Texas Lottery staff and the more than 16,000 Lottery retailers across Texas, we continue to provide needed revenue to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "We will continue to provide entertaining online and scratch-off games for our players to support public education in our state."

The Texas Lottery has transferred more than $17.5 billion in revenue to the state since May of 1992 when tickets first went on sale. From 1992 to 1997, proceeds were allocated to the General Revenue Fund. Since a change in the law in 1997, net revenue from the sale of Lottery products is transferred to the FSF to support education in the state. Players have claimed more than $32.7 billion in prizes since startup, and Texas Lottery retailers have received bonuses and commissions in excess of $2.8 billion.
