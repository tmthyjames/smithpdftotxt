TEXAS LOTTERY® JOINS AWARENESS EFFORTS OF NATIONAL PROBLEM GAMBLING AWARENESS WEEK
(Austin) ­ This week, the Texas Lottery® joins the National Council on Problem Gambling in observing National Problem Gambling Awareness Week, through March 13. Groups nationwide are working to increase awareness about the negative impacts of problem gambling and provide information on resources for those dealing with gambling-related issues. "The Texas Lottery Commission continues to remind players to enjoy our games responsibly," said Texas Lottery Commission Deputy Executive Director Gary Grief. "If that becomes a struggle, we want people to know where they can find problem-gambling resources." The Texas Lottery Web site includes a "Play Responsibly" page with phone numbers and online links to resources for problem gambling. The "Play Responsibly" message is also included on all tickets and agency brochures. According to Charitable Bingo Operations Director Phil Sanderson, the same message applies for bingo players. "We are proud that licensed bingo in Texas helps charitable groups fund worthy projects throughout the state. If playing bingo starts to have a negative effect on someone, however, we want them to recognize that help is available." Some warning signs of problem gambling include a preoccupation with gambling, gambling to win back losses, lying about gambling, and jeopardizing jobs or relationships with gambling-related behavior. Anyone who suspects that they or someone they know may have a problem is encouraged to contact their healthcare provider or an organization specializing in problem-gambling issues. (more)
