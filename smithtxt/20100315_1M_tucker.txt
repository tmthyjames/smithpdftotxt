ONLINE INFORMATION LEADS RICHMOND RESIDENT TO $1 MILLION TEXAS LOTTERY® SCRATCH-OFF WIN
(Austin) ­ After looking up scratch-off game information on the official Texas Lottery® Web site at http://www.txlottery.org, Larry W. Tucker Jr. of Richmond purchased a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket. His research paid off when the ticket revealed a $1 million prize. "I went on the Internet and looked at the prizes left. This one seemed like the one to get, so I did," explained Tucker. "It took a minute, well it took a long time really, to sink in. I didn't believe it until I brought it in and validated it." Tucker's win is the 15th prize of $1 million to be claimed in the $500,000,000 Blockbuster game. Six top prizes worth $2.5 million each and 25 prizes of $1 million remain unclaimed. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 2.77, including break-even prizes. Hoping to continue his good fortune, Tucker says he'll keep playing both scratch-off and on-line games in the future. "This has shown me that there are some big prizes out there. You hear about it and read about it, but now I'm a believer." "Many of our winners have trouble believing their good fortune at first. It may seem too good to be true, but real Texans do win large prizes," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "In fact, the Texas Lottery has paid out almost $33 billion in total prizes since the first ticket was sold in May of 1992." (more)
