HELPING FRIENDS AND FAMILY RESULTS IN $20,000 BLAZING 8'S PRIZE FOR SAN ANTONIO RESIDENT
(Austin) ­ This Saturday was a busy one for Rick Reyes of San Antonio. He was babysitting for a friend when he received a call asking him to pick up his sister-in-law from work. While out, he stopped to refuel and bought a $2 Blazing 8's Texas Lottery® scratch-off ticket. "I scratched it while I was pumping gas. I started at the bottom and saw the $20,000," said Reyes. "I called my mom and told her. She was jumping and yelling." Reyes claimed the second of nine top prizes in the Blazing 8's game and plans to use the money to pay bills, help his family, and possibly do some remodeling on his house. "After an eventful weekend, Mr. Reyes got his week off to a good start by claiming his prize at the Texas Lottery Field Office in San Antonio," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We congratulate him on his top-prize win." This winning ticket was purchased at the Big Diamond #1042, 6180 Walzem Road in San Antonio. Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $51 million. Wednesday's drawings include an estimated Powerball® jackpot of $81 million and an estimated Lotto Texas® jackpot of $68 million.
