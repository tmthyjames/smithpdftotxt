MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT INCREASES TO MASSIVE $266 MILLION
(Austin) ­Texas Lottery® players have access to the three largest jackpots in the country this week beginning with Tuesday's massive Mega Millions® game drawing. The estimated annuitized jackpot stands at $266 million. Cash value option players will be trying for a staggering $165.2 million estimated jackpot. Mega Millions players purchased over 72,000 winning tickets, including one lucky Mega Millions player who bought a 5 of 5 second-tier prize winner, good for $250,000, at Donut Plus in Nacogdoches. The second largest jackpot in the country is in Lotto Texas®. The jackpot for Wednesday's drawing will be an estimated $87 million, the highest Lotto Texas jackpot since the $145 million record was set in June 2004. Along with Lotto Texas, players are also able to play Powerball® for the third largest jackpot in the country. The estimated annuitized Powerball jackpot is up to $60 million for Wednesday's drawing. All three jackpot games can be purchased at any of the more than 16,000 Texas Lottery licensed retailers throughout the state. "We are always working to make our games exciting for our players," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Players are always interested in big jackpots, and we are proud to be able to offer them the opportunity to play for the three largest jackpots in the United States right here in Texas." The Texas Lottery reminds its players to sign the back of each ticket upon purchase and to play responsibly; it only takes one ticket to win. ###
