LOYAL MONTHLY BONUS PLAYER FROM BAYTOWN WINS $10,000 PER MONTH FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS
(Austin) ­ When Alton R Williams Jr of Baytown purchased a Texas Lottery® Monthly Bonus ticket at his local Sam's Express, it wasn't anything new. A loyal player, he's enjoyed the game almost every week for years. In fact, he won a $2,000 Monthly Bonus prize some time ago, but this time he was in for a surprise worth a total of $2.4 million. Williams says he took his tickets home to scratch them. "My wife was with me. I bought a ticket for her, too, and she won $5." It was his ticket, however, which revealed the top prize of $10,000 each month for the next 20 years. He wasn't going to let the ticket get away from him. "I slept with it in the bed, under the mattress," said Williams. This is the second of four top prizes to be claimed in the Montly Bonus game, which features a total of more than $52.3 million in prizes. Overall odds of winning any prize are one in 4.94. "Like many of our annuity games, the Monthly Bonus remains popular year after year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's always fun to meet a loyal player like Mr. Williams who wins big with these entertaining scratch-offs." Despite his win, Williams says he will continue his work as a heavy equipment operator, and he knows just how to use this windfall.
