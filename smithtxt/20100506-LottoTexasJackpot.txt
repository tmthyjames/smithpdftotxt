LOTTO TEXAS® BOASTS LARGEST U.S. JACKPOT
(Austin) ­ Everything's bigger in the Lone Star State, and that includes Texas Lottery® jackpots. No ticket matched all six numbers in last night's Lotto Texas® drawing, pushing the estimated annuitized jackpot to $88 million for Saturday's drawing, the highest in the nation and second highest in the world. Only the EuroMillions jackpot is larger. "Lotto Texas is our flagship game, and it has a loyal following among Texas Lottery players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We are proud to offer this exciting game, which has successfully generated revenue for the state of Texas since 1992." Two other Texas Lottery games round out the top three jackpots in the United States. Saturday's Powerball® drawing is number two with an estimated annuitized jackpot of $80 million, and Friday's $12 million Mega Millions® jackpot holds the number-three spot. The Texas Lottery reminds its players to sign the back of each ticket upon purchase and to play responsibly; it only takes one ticket to win. ###
