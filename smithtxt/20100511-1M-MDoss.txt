POWERBALL® AWARDS TEXAS' FIRST $1 MILLION POWER PLAY® PRIZE TO PLAYER FROM LLANO
(AUSTIN) ­ Mark E. Doss of Llano claimed the first-ever $1 million Powerball® with Power Play® prize awarded in Texas. Doss matched all five numbers, 13-34-40-47-57, but not the Powerball, 11, for the May 5 drawing. Texas Lottery® players can choose the Power Play feature for an extra $1 per Powerball play board. Power Play provides the chance to increase each non-grand/jackpot prize by up to five times. When a player chooses this option and wins the Match 5 prize, matching all of the numbers except the red Powerball, that player's $200,000 second-tier prize is automatically multiplied five times for a $1 million win. During the Power Play 10X promotion currently underway, non-grand/jackpot prizes could be increased up to ten times if the 10X multiplier is selected. The 10X multiplier would raise the Match 5 prize to $2 million; however, the multiplier four was chosen when this ticket won on May 5. Doss, who requested minimal publicity, purchased his ticket at the Common Man Travel Center located at 2751 W. State Highway 29 in Burnet. Wednesday's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $97 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $89 million. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $19 million.
