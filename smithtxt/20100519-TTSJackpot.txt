TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT REACHES HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN A YEAR; PLAYERS CAN TRY FOR $1.35 MILLION
(Austin) ­Texas Lottery® players can play for $1.35 million in tomorrow night's Texas Two Step® drawing. That's the highest jackpot for this game since March of last year. "The big jackpot games may get more attention, but Texas Two Step has attracted a loyal following with its easy play style, good odds and significant jackpots," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. The Texas Two Step, like its name suggests, requires two steps to play. Step one: Select four numbers from one to 35. Step two: Select a Bonus Ball number from one to 35. Prizes start at $5 for matching only the Bonus Ball number. The overall odds of winning any Texas Two Step prize are one in 32, and drawings are held Mondays and Thursdays. Also featuring impressive jackpots, tonight's Powerball® drawing has an estimated jackpot of $145 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $93 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $54 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official website at www.txlottery.org. ###
