FIRST $50,000 TOP PRIZE AWARDED IN JUMBO BUCKS III
(Austin) ­ Just one week ago, the Texas Lottery® introduced the new Jumbo Bucks III game, and it's already paying out exciting cash prizes. Paige resident Gayna Reed claimed the first $50,000 top prize today, but it's not her first time to win. "I played the first Jumbo Bucks about eight years ago and won $500 on that one," said Reed. Her previous win led her to try the game again. "I bought a ticket Friday and won $10, so I took it back to the same store and used it to buy this ticket." Reed purchased her top-prize winning ticket at Terry's Corner located at 1146 Highway 21 East in Paige. With more than $41 million in total prizes, the $2 Jumbo Bucks III has overall odds of one in 4.36, including break-even prizes. "The Jumbo Bucks games have been popular with our players over the years, but we feel these scratch-offs are even better this year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Jumbo Bucks III features second-chance drawings for cash prizes up to $100,000, Giant Jumbo Bucks III includes second-chance prizes up to $500,000, and Mega Jumbo Bucks III offers second chances to win up to $1 million." Only non-winning tickets can be entered into the four second-chance drawings. The entry deadline for the first second-chance drawing is July 30. Detailed information on how to enter the drawings is printed on the back of the tickets or is available on the Texas Lottery website. Although she almost hyperventilated when she first saw her prize, Reed has calmed down and says she has a plan for her prize money. (more)

(Texas Lottery Commission, News Release, continued) "We'll pay off some bills and, of course, take a vacation," she explained. "Then we'll put the rest in savings." Her winning philosophy is simple, "If you don't play, you can't win!" Tomorrow's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $64 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $190 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $95 million.
