TWO TEXAS LOTTERY® RETAILERS AWARDED $50,000
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas Lottery® officials presented checks worth $50,000 each to two Dallas-Fort Worth area retailers as part of an incentive program designed to increase sales of Texas Lottery tickets and revenue to the Foundation School Fund. From January 17 to April 17, eligible retailers participated in a sales incentive program offering cash payments to retailers who met certain sales goals. Those retailers who met their sales goals were then entered into a drawing for prizes ranging from $500 to $50,000. "Texas Lottery retailers work hard every day to assist the agency in generating revenue for the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in the state of Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Incentive programs, like this one, allow the agency to encourage our licensed retailers' efforts."
