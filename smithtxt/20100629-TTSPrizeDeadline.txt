DEADLINE NEARS FOR $675,000 TEXAS TWO STEP® JACKPOT PRIZE FROM DRAWING HELD IN JANUARY
(AUSTIN) ­ Texas Lottery® officials are asking Texas Two Step® players to check their tickets as the July 10 deadline approaches to claim a prize from the January 11 drawing. With less than two weeks to go, the Texas Two Step jackpot worth $675,000 remains unclaimed. A Quick Pick ticket purchased at the Quiktrip #950, 701 W. Harris Road in Arlington, matched all four numbers (17 ­ 22 ­ 26 ­ 27) and the Bonus Ball (11). "We know that a winning ticket was sold in Arlington, but we have yet to hear from the winner," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We encourage anyone who may have purchased a ticket for that drawing to check their numbers because they will need to stop by their local Texas Lottery claim center or mail the ticket no later than the end of next week." If no one claims the prize, the money will be transferred into the Unclaimed Prize Fund. The first $10 million in unclaimed prizes each fiscal year are transferred to the Department of State Health Services for the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account, and additional unclaimed prizes go to the state's General Revenue Fund. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $16 million. Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $27 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. Thursday's Texas Two Step jackpot will be $225,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official website at www.txlottery.org. ###
