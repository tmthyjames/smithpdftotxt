15-YEAR CASH FIVE® PLAYER FROM OKLAHOMA CLAIMS WEDNESDAY'S TOP PRIZE WORTH $21,914
(AUSTIN) ­ While watching the news, Dianne McColister of Fort Towson, Oklahoma, noticed that the winning Cash Five® numbers from last night's drawing looked familiar, 15 ­ 2 ­ 24 ­ 10 ­ 36. They were the same numbers she's played many times before, and as she checked her Cash Five ticket sitting conveniently nearby, she realized she'd won. "I wasn't sure at first. Then I checked again. It was great," said McColister. She brought her winning ticket to the Texas Lottery® claim center in Dallas this morning to retrieve her prize of $21,914, and she says she'll continue to play. "I've been playing for about 15 years, off and on," she explained. "I've played other games, but I haven't gotten this lucky until now. I thank the Lord for this." This was the only ticket to match all five numbers for last night's drawing. Another 64 tickets matched four of five numbers for second-tier prizes worth $154 each. Overall odds of winning any Cash Five prize are one in eight. "Many of our players enjoy the improved odds and easy playstyle offered by the Cash Five game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's great to see a longtime player like Ms. McColister win the top prize."
