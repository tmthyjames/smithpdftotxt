IRVING RESIDENT SELECTS MEGAPLIER® OPTION, BOOSTS MEGA MILLIONS® PRIZE TO $1 MILLION
(AUSTIN) ­ Billy P. Coleman of Irving didn't have to hit the jackpot to win big in the Mega Millions® drawing held on July 27. His numbers matched all five numbers drawn (2 ­ 7 ­ 10 ­ 16 ­ 29) but not the Mega Ball (8). Because he chose the Megaplier® option, his $250,000 secondtier prize was multiplied by the Megaplier number, which was four, for a total prize of $1 million. Coleman, who requested minimal publicity, selected his own numbers for the ticket purchased at the A-Z Food Mart located at 2400 W. 4th St. in Irving. Mega Millions drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays. Tonight's drawing features an estimated $42 million jackpot prize with an estimated cash value of $27.8 million. Wednesday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million.
