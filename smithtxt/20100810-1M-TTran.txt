ROUND ROCK RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION WITH POWER PLAY® FEATURE FROM POWERBALL®
(AUSTIN) ­ Saturday's Powerball® drawing didn't produce a grand/jackpot winner, but that didn't stop Tri T. Tran of Round Rock from claiming a $1 million prize. Thanks to the Power Play® feature, matching all five numbers (4 ­ 22 ­ 26 ­ 31 ­ 52) but not the Powerball (30) was enough to win $1 million. For an extra $1 per play, Powerball players can increase their non-grand/jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4 or 5 times, and the Match 5 prize is automatically bumped to $1 million. Tran, who requested minimal publicity, purchased the winning ticket at the Deepwood Exxon located at 1545 Highway 620 in Round Rock. Tomorrow's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $38 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $6 million. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $64 million.
