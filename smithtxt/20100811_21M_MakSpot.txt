RICHARDSON-BASED PARTNERSHIP CLAIMS

LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT FROM JULY DRAWING
(AUSTIN) ­ Mak Spot, LP, by Mak Spot GP, LLC, by Kyle W. Pogue, President, today claimed the Lotto Texas® jackpot from the drawing held on Saturday, July 31. The Quick Pick ticket matched all six numbers, 8 ­ 19 ­ 29 ­ 44 ­ 46 ­ 48, for the $21 million advertised jackpot. Because the Richardson-based partnership selected the Cash Value Option, they will receive a lump sum payment worth $14,155,747.20, before taxes. The Sunlight Food Mart, 1935 S. Jupiter Road in Garland, will also benefit from this win. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible for a retailer bonus of $210,000. The partnership requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $6 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $38 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $75 million.
