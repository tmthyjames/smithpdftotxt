FIRST $100,000 SECOND-CHANCE PRIZE AWARDED IN JUMBO BUCKS III GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ Gene Spradlin of Longview is a man who values second chances, especially when it comes to Texas Lottery® games. It's no surprise then that he was drawn to the Jumbo Bucks III scratchoff game. Spradlin won $100,000 in the first of four second-chance drawings. "I have always sent tickets in," explained Spradlin. In fact, he won a second-chance prize in a previous game, World Poker Tour® $100,000 Texas Hold `EmTM. "I like to buy those scratch-offs because they give me a second chance." Spradlin is also looking forward to a second chance in his professional life. He hopes that this win will allow him to start his own business. "It's the start of another phase of life that I never thought I'd be able to have." The Jumbo Bucks III game features more than $41 million in prizes, including 21 instant-win prizes of $50,000 each. Players who don't win instantly can send in their tickets for a chance to win secondchance prizes of $1,000 to $100,000. "We've offered other Jumbo Bucks games in the past, but Jumbo Bucks III, Giant Jumbo Bucks III and Mega Jumbo Bucks III are unique in being the first suite of games offered at different price points with such large cash prizes available through second-chance drawings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "These games are perfect for Texas Lottery players like Mr. Spradlin who enjoy another chance to win." Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $75 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $51 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million.
