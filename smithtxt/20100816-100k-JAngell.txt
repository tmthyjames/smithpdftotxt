HONDO RESIDENT STARTS WEEK RIGHT WITH $100,000 WIN IN INSTANT POWERBALL® GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ He's been playing Texas Lottery® games since day one, but today was a little different for Jon Angell of Hondo. He stopped at the Noor Pantry, 8005 Bandera Road in San Antonio, this morning and purchased some tickets, as he often does. This was no ordinary Monday morning purchase, though. Outside the store, he scratched off an Instant Powerball® ticket which revealed a top prize worth $100,000. "I love playing the game because sometimes I win the free Powerball tickets," said Angell. "I was dumbfounded when I saw this. I stared at the ticket for about five minutes." Finally, Angell went back in the store and used their Check-a-Ticket terminal to be sure he'd really won. After sharing his excitement with the store clerk, he made his way to the Texas Lottery Claim Center in San Antonio to receive his prize. This is the fourth of six $100,000 top prizes to be awarded in the Instant Powerball game following its introduction in June. With more than $20 million in total prizes, overall odds of winning any prize are one in 2.80, including break-even prizes. "The Instant Powerball game has been among our top-selling games thanks in part to the free Powerball tickets the game offers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "It's an ideal game for players like Mr. Angell who enjoy Texas Lottery instant tickets as much as they enjoy our jackpot games like Powerball."

(Texas Lottery Commission, News Release, continued) Although he just won this morning, Angell already has a plan for his prize money. He'll put part of the money in savings and use the rest to fix up some land he and his wife purchased. Angell says he'll continue buying his favorite tickets. "Now I have even more incentive to play." Tuesday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $86 million. Wednesday's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $64 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $5 million.
