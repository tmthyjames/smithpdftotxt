PALESTINE WOMAN FOLLOWS WINNING STREAK TO $1 MILLION PRIZE IN $500,000,000 BLOCKBUSTER
(AUSTIN) ­ A winning streak that started Sunday led Brenda Richardson of Palestine to purchase a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket at J J's #211. That ticket revealed one of 40 $1 million prizes available in the game. "I bought a ticket Sunday and won some money and cashed it in," said Richardson, who used her winnings to buy a $500,000,000 Blockbuster ticket. "I won $50 on that one and bought another, and won $100 on that one and got this ticket." Although she just purchased her winning ticket yesterday, Richardson already has a clear idea of how she'll use the money. "Like everyone, I want to pay off some debts. I'll also put some away for retirement. Mainly, I keep telling myself to be calm and be wise." Richardson received her prize at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Tyler, but she won't be the only one to benefit from the win. For selling the winning ticket, J J's #211, 1901 Crockett Road in Palestine, is eligible for a retailer bonus of $10,000. "The $500,000,000 Blockbuster has been a particularly successful game, regularly showing up as our top-selling scratch-off. It's good news for our retailers and even better news for Texas education because revenues from the game support the Foundation School Fund," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief.
