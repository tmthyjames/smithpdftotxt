MISSOURI CITY RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION WITH MEGAPLIER®
(Austin) ­ The Mega Millions® jackpot is currently an estimated $312 million, with the potential for a record-breaking jackpot if no tickets match all six numbers for the grand/jackpot prize, but one Texas Lottery® player from Missouri City is already enjoying that winning feeling. Evelyn Grays Calvin won $1 million in the Mega Millions drawing held Tuesday, March 22. Calvin, who requested minimal publicity, matched five numbers (1 ­ 14 ­ 35 ­ 50 ­ 53) but not the Mega Ball (43) on a Quick Pick ticket she purchased at the Missouri Food Mart located at 1300 Turtle Creek Ste. 1312 in Missouri City. Normally, this would entitle her to a second-tier prize of $250,000; however, since she selected the Megaplier option her ticket became an automatic $1 million winner. "The anticipation is building for tonight's drawing throughout the state and even nationwide," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "We are excited about the revenue this high jackpot could generate for the Foundation School Fund and public education in Texas, but we also want to remind our players to enjoy our games responsibly. It only takes one ticket to win." Tonight's estimated $312 million jackpot is the sixth-highest in Mega Millions history. Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $125 million. Taken together, those two jackpots represent the highest combined amount since a large number of lotteries began offering both games in January 2010.
