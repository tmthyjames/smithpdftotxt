TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM AUSTIN CLAIMS $1 MILLION THANKS TO POWERBALL® WITH POWER PLAY®

(Austin) ­ Texas Lottery® player Michelle Hunter of Austin could have won $200,000 in the Powerball® drawing held March 26. She matched all five numbers (4 ­ 10 ­ 11 ­ 19 ­ 33), but not the Powerball (27), qualifying her for the second-tier prize. It was her decision to try the Power Play® add-on feature, however, that changed her fate, increasing her win by five times to $1 million. For an extra $1 per play, Texas Lottery players have the opportunity to increase their non-grand/jackpot Powerball winnings by two, three, four or five times with the Power Play add-on feature. If a player wins the Match 5 prize with Power Play, the $200,000 prize is automatically multiplied five times for a $1 million win. Hunter purchased her ticket at the CMart Icehouse located at 1308 W. Koenig Lane in Austin. This claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $19 million. Saturday's Powerball jackpot is an estimated $72 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $4 million.
