BEAUMONT RESIDENT COLLECTS

LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT FROM TEXAS LOTTERY®
(Austin) ­Salvador Salazar Jr of Beaumont visited Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to collect a Lotto Texas® jackpot prize advertised at $15 million for the April 20 drawing. He bought the Quick Pick cash value option ticket at Dos Amigas, a convenience store located at 1180 Ave. C in Beaumont. Selling this ticket makes the retailer eligible to receive a bonus equal to one percent of the advertised jackpot, $150,000. Because Salazar purchased the ticket with the cash value option, the prize he took home is worth $9.6 million, before taxes. The numbers selected in last Wednesday's drawing were 9-28-36-3841-42. The new winner requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $5 million, and the Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million. Friday's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $40 million. There is more information about the Texas Lottery available on the official website, www.txlottery.org.
