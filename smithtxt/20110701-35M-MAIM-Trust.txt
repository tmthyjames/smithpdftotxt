$35 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT FROM MAY 27 CLAIMED BY MAIM REVOCABLE TRUST
(Austin) ­ MAIM Revocable Trust, represented by Jim R. Ross, Trustee, of Arlington, claimed the Mega Millions® grand/jackpot prize from the May 27 drawing. The winning ticket matched all five numbers drawn, 5 ­ 7 ­ 14 ­ 28 ­ 56 and the Mega Ball 10. Ross said, "The recipients are very excited about this win, and obviously, this has been quite a lifestyle change for them. It's been a fun process dealing with that adjustment." The final total value of the annuitized prize is $35,216,748.92. MAIM Revocable Trust will receive an initial payment of $1,366,748.52 and 25 annual payments of $1,354,000. "It's no wonder the trust members are excited about such a significant prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "I'm sure the win pleased Tommy's #10, too. The retailer is eligible for a $350,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket." Tommy's #10 is located at 321 S. Morgan in Granbury. This is the first Mega Millions grand/jackpot ticket to be sold in Granbury. Retailers in Granbury, however, have sold three Lotto Texas® jackpotwinning tickets. The McCraw Family Partnership, Ltd., claimed the largest of the three as an annuity in February 1996 for a total value of more than $21 million, before taxes. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $105 million. Tomorrow's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $20 million, and the Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $6 million.
