TEXAS LOTTERY® PLAYER FROM ARLINGTON WINS JULY 20 CASH FIVE® PRIZE WORTH $20,127
(Austin) ­ Linda J. Hart of Arlington has played Texas Lottery® games on and off for the past 12 years. She often uses family birthdays to pick her numbers, but it was a Quick Pick ticket that provided the top prize from the July 20 Cash Five® drawing. "I went to the store and got the winning numbers printed out," Hart explained. "I went back to my daughter's house, checked the ticket and screamed. I was extremely happy." The ticket matched all five number drawn, 7 ­ 8 ­ 15 ­ 23 ­ 31, for a prize of $20,127. For selling the winning ticket, Rob's Drive In, 226 East Commerce in Fairfield, is eligible for a retailer bonus worth $201.27. "Many Texas Lottery players enjoy Cash Five because it is easy to play and offers good odds for a drawing game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Overall odds of winning any prize are one in eight, and drawings are held nightly Monday through Saturday." Hart says she wants to do something new with her prize. "I plan to get the car fixed and go on a cruise. I have never been on one." Tonight's Mega Millions® jackpot is an estimated $53 million. Saturday's Powerball® jackpot is an estimated $92 million, and the Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $12 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, visit www.txlottery.org. ###
