Where, Oh Where, Is The Winning Ticket?
(Austin, September 21) - - Time is running out! It has been ninety days already and no one has stepped forward to claim the jackpot from the Lotto Texas drawing held June 23, 2001. The clock is ticking for whomever holds the single ticket that matched all six numbers for the $13 million jackpot. Claimants have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim a prize. The winning ticket was purchased in Humble at Copperfield Liquor #6, located at 7540 FM 1960 East. The retailer received his bonus of $130,000, and is doing his best to locate the winner. "We talk about it as much as we can to our customers," said Copperfield owner Gary Hmaidan. "A lot of players take awhile to check their tickets, and the longer they wait the greater chance there is of losing it. We tell players they should really check tickets quicker." The only Lotto Texas jackpot ever to go unclaimed was six years ago in April of 1995. The $12.4 million jackpot-winning ticket was purchased in Flower Mound for the drawing held October 26, 1994. "This ticket, worth an estimated $13 million, is out there somewhere, and we want to hear from our next prospective winner," said Linda Cloud, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We urge our players, who live in Humble or who may have been traveling through the area, to recheck their old tickets or look for ones they may have set aside." Cloud noted that media stories about an unclaimed $46 million "Big Game" jackpot prompted a man to remember that he had been in the store that sold the winning ticket. He found the ticket and claimed his prize just in time to beat the deadline. The last day to claim the $13 million Lotto Texas jackpot prize will be December 20, 2001. The ticket must be presented at lottery headquarters in Austin and validated by lottery security. Saturday's estimated Lotto Texas jackpot is $23 million. -30-
