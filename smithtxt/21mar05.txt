One Mega MillionsTM Ticket Sold In Rowlett Matches All Numbers Drawn For $112 Million Jackpot
(Austin, March 2) - One ticket purchased in Texas matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in Tuesday night's Mega MillionsTM drawing. The estimated jackpot for that drawing was $112 million, with a Cash Value Option of more than $68 million. The ticket was purchased at Dal-Rock Grocery located at 5522 Chiesa Rd. in Rowlett. The retailer that sold the ticket may be eligible for a bonus of up to $1 million. "Texas Independence Day is always an exciting day in our state, but somebody in Rowlett has really got a lot to be excited about today," said Reagan E. Greer executive director Texas Lottery Commission. "This is the second time a ticket matching all of the Mega Millions drawing numbers has been sold in Texas since we joined the multi-state game in December 2003. In both cases, the estimated jackpot was more than $100 million, further proof that we like to do things big in Texas." The first Mega Millions jackpot won in Texas was claimed by Ut Van Nguyen of Carrollton, who collected $62,060,880, the Cash Value Option of the $101 million jackpot for the October 1, 2004, drawing. "We're really looking forward to meeting whoever purchased this ticket," said Greer. "So far, all we know aside from where the ticket was bought, is that the ticket was a Quick Pick and that the purchaser chose the Cash Value Option." Prizes of $1 million or more, and all prizes that are paid out in annuity payments must be claimed at the Texas Lottery Commission Headquarters in Austin. Prizes must be claimed no later than 180 days after the draw date. The numbers from Tuesday night's drawing were 1-8-18-39-48, MB 1. In addition to the possible jackpot-winning ticket, Texas Mega Millions players statewide purchased 72,143 tickets worth $462,987 in lower-tier prizes. One ticket, which matched four numbers plus the Mega Ball, would have been worth $5,000 but the purchaser also bought the MegaplierTM, which increased the value to $20,000. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier feature, available only in Texas, allows players the chance to double, triple or quadruple

any Mega Millions non-grand/jackpot prize. Last night's Megaplier number was 4. In addition to Texas, Mega Millions is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Washington. Mega Millions drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays. Mega Millions jackpots start at $10 million and other prizes range from $2 to $175,000.
