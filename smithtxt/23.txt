A Hungry Son and a Jackpot-Winning Lotto Texas Ticket Gives Seguin Man Something To Be `Happy' About!
(Austin, September 5) - On Saturday, August 18th, "Happy" Roberts' hungry son wanted to eat at a local fast food restaurant. On the way, he remembered he needed to buy his usual $5 worth of Lotto Texas tickets for the drawing that evening. So he stopped at Pic N Pac #10 in Seguin, a place he had never bought his Lotto tickets before, and ended up $20 million richer by the end of the weekend. "I've always told people I was going to win," said Roberts. "I bought a paper the next morning and when I saw the numbers matched I started shaking and kept shaking for three more hours. Then I called my wife, Jeralyn to tell her, and she told me that 'Right now isn't a good time to be joking around.' " After finally persuading her that he wasn't 'joking around,' the two decided to meet back at home. He then took the time to call his long time friend and business partner, Rick Davis, to tell him the good news. The two started a lawn mowing service last year. "He (Roberts) called me and said 'I just won $20 million,' " Davis said. "I told him I didn't believe it, but you could hear it in his voice that he was serious. He told me, 'I'm officially retired as of right now! We'll never have to mow another lawn.' " On his way back home, Roberts stopped at the store he bought his ticket to have the clerk check it also. When he walked into the store holding what he thought was the winning ticket, the clerk asked him, "Are you the one?" "I told her 'I think so,' " Roberts said. "She told me if I was then I was going to get a big hug, and she did it too!" For selling the jackpot-winning ticket, owners of Pic N Pac #10, located at 109 Highway 123, are eligible to receive a $200,000 bonus. The winning numbers drawn were: 18-01-52-45-32-26. According to Davis, Roberts told him he plans on buying a Harley motorcycle, and his wife wants a Harley special edition Ford F150 pickup truck. The couple has also started looking at RVs to do a little traveling. His son wants a Lamborghini; however, there has been no immediate response to that request. Their two daughters just want "mama to stay home." Roberts' ticket was the only one sold matching all six numbers for the Saturday, August 18th Lotto Texas drawing worth an estimated $20 million. He chose the Cash Value Option, and today the Texas Lottery Commission presented a ceremonial check in the amount of $11,320,320 to Black Pearl, Ltd. To celebrate his win, Roberts showed up at Lottery Headquarters this morning in a white stretch limousine accompanied by his wife, Jeralyn and friend, Rick Davis. Roberts told lottery officials he had originally wanted to bring his jackpot-winning Lotto Texas ticket in an armored truck. He chose to carry it in a fire-proof safety box instead. "That way I kept it with me," said Roberts. -30.... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time."
