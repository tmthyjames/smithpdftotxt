Lottery Sales For Fiscal Year 2001 Up
(Austin, September 5) - Sales of Texas Lottery tickets have exceeded the previous year's sales by six percent. "The change to the Lotto Texas matrix in July of 2000 and the introduction of Texas Two Step in May have been the catalysts to greater sales during the fiscal year that just ended," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud. "Our sales certainly demonstrate that players throughout the state have renewed their interest in our existing games, and have also tried our newest games." Figures for fiscal year (FY) 2001 are preliminary and will not be audited numbers until December. Lotto Texas was the big sales story for FY 2001. Players bought $695,273,661-worth of Lotto tickets, compared with $583,467,709 in FY 2000. The difference means players purchased $111,805,952 more during the current fiscal year, which represents an increase of almost 19.16 percent in Lotto sales. The game represents 24.61 percent of all sales. Instant tickets registered sales of $1,715,799,826 for FY 2001, approximately $52 million or just over three percent more than the previous year. Instant tickets represent 60.7 percent of all sales. Total sales for all games for fiscal year 2001, September 1, 2000 to August 31, 2001, came to $2,825,521,559. "Our sales tell the story for this fiscal year," Cloud said. "We're very pleased to report the increase in sales, and we want to thank our players and retailers for the support they continue to give to the Games of Texas."
