WEEKLY GRANDTM WIN PUTS PASADENA COUPLE "ON THE ROAD" TO RETIREMENT TRAVEL
(Austin, August 31) - (AUSTIN) ­ Winning Weekly Grand means John and Martha Harsey of Pasadena can fulfill their dream of seeing the U.S.A. in a big way. Harsey, a 60-year-old crane operator from Pasadena, just won $1.04 million playing one of the Texas Lottery's most popular instant games, Weekly Grand. Harsey bought the ticket at the Top Stop Store, 706 Pasadena Boulevard in Pasadena, and scratched it off while he was still in the store. He knew he'd won the top prize on what he calls his favorite game when he saw, a "6," then a "5," then GRAND. "I told my wife, `Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!' and went out to my truck," he said. "I just sat there for a while, staring at the ticket." When his wife came outside, she found him looking off into space and looking pale as a sheet. Harsey showed the ticket to his wife, who took one look at it and said, "Oh, my God, we did it!" Harsey plays Weekly Grand often, and had already won $300 -- the other large prize in this game -- several times. The ticket bought August 26th was worth a bit more: $1,000 a week for twenty years. Players can win the Weekly Grand top-prize two ways: · On Game 1, if YOUR number beats THEIR number in any one row across, and the prize category shows GRAND, the player wins $1,000 a week for 20 years. This is how Mr. Harsey won. · On Game 2, players win by matching three like amounts. If three GRAND symbols are shown, the player wins $1,000 a week for 20 years. Mr. Harsey plans to retire in a year or so, and his winnings will give him and his wife a good head start on the vacation they dream of. "We really want to see the sights of America," he said. "We've already gone some places, now this will let us see a whole lot more." As of August 31, there are three $1,000-a-week tickets remaining in the Weekly Grand game. -30....
