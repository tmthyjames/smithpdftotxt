CASH 5 WINNER COOLLY COLLECTS $29,890
(Austin, August 29) - (AUSTIN) ­ Today, 44-year-old Isabel Alvarez is much calmer than she was yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, Alvarez went to her favorite retailer to check the Cash 5 numbers from Monday night's drawing, and realized she had matched all five of the winning numbers. "She thought she had only matched four numbers at first," said Alvarez' daughter, Maria Utierrez. "When she realized she had gotten all five, she started jumping up and down. She couldn't even talk she was so happy." According to Utierrez, her mother always buys her tickets at Sack N Save #216, at 2500 South Carrier Parkway in Grand Prairie. "She always plays Cash 5 and Lotto Texas, and her husband won about $4,000 from Lotto Texas six months ago," Utierrez said. Utierrez told lottery officials her mother wants to use the money as a down payment for a house. The winning numbers drawn for Monday night's game were: 15-35-28-10-18. Alvarez randomly chose her numbers over four years ago, and has continued to play that same set of numbers since then. There were two winning tickets sold for the Monday, August 27th drawing, therefore the top-prize will be split between the two winners. For selling a top-prize winning Cash 5 ticket, Sack N Save owners are eligible for a one-percent bonus of $298.90. The other ticket was purchased at Rush N Grocery, located at 11705 FM 1764 in Santa Fe. That lottery retailer is also eligible for a bonus of $289.90. Cash 5 began in October 1995 and since its inception has produced 2,315 top-prize winners. Cash 5 sales total more than $1.3 billion since its start-up, and represents 5.2 percent of total Texas Lottery sales. -30....
