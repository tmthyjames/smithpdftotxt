$20 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS JACKPOT TICKET SOLD IN TEXARKANA CLAIMED
(Austin, August 6) - Cordova Springs, A Partnership, didn't waste much time in coming to Austin to pick up the prize from the July 28th Lotto Texas drawing. The partnership today was presented with a ceremonial check in the amount of $11,190,952.00 for matching the six winning numbers in the Lotto Texas $20 million drawing nine days ago. Larry Stack of Cordova, Tennessee, and Chris Fellows of Hot Springs, Arkansas, represented the partnership at today's ceremonial check presentation ceremony. The winning Quick Pick ticket was purchased with a Cash Value Option, which gives the winner the net present value of the jackpot, approximately half of the advertised jackpot. For selling the winning ticket, the Triple J Convenience Store, 5121 Summerhill Road in Texarkana is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, which comes to $200,000. The winning numbers were 54-04-33-21-46-47. "I gave Chris $60 to buy lottery tickets in Texas, $40 for the 7-28 drawing and $20 for future drawings," Stack said. "She left me a voice mail on her way to see family in Texas right before she bought the tickets, and she asked me if I wanted to claim the jackpot in a lump sum or in an annuity. She was laughing when she left me that message, and naturally, I heard it and erased it. Didn't give it another thought." Stack said Fellows kept the winning ticket with her at all times, "Real close to her heart." Both are employees of United Parcel Service (UPS) and plan to retire soon. The partnership requested minimal publicity. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $9 million. ....
