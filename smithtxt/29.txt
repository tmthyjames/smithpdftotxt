WEEKLY GRAND PAYS OFF FOR LOYAL PLAYER
(Austin, August 2) - Weekly Grand, one of the Texas Lottery's most popular instant games, just made Rodney McDonald of New Caney one happy guy. Today, the loyal ticket player became the 49th winner of the Weekly Grand top-prize, which pays $1,000 a week for 20 years. "I've been playing almost every day since it came out," said McDonald. McDonald bought his winning Weekly Grand ticket at On The Go Foods, located at 17756 FM 1485 in New Caney. After making his purchase, McDonald went out to his truck where he scratched off the first section of the game. "My number came up a 'four' and the other number came up a 'one' and then I saw GRAND," he explained. "After that, I just took a deep breath and went home. I didn't even scratch off the rest of the ticket." When he arrived at his house, McDonald said he showed the ticket to his brother and a friend. His brother scratched off the remaining parts of the ticket thinking there had to be more to it, but McDonald assured him, "that's it, I won." Players can win the Weekly Grand top-prize two ways: · On Game 1, if YOUR number beats THEIR number in any one row across and the prize category shows GRAND, the player wins $1,000 a week for 20 years. · On Game 2, players win by matching three like amounts. If three GRAND symbols are shown, the player wins $1,000 a week for 20 years. According to McDonald, after he checked with lottery officials at the Houston Lottery Claim Center, he returned to the store and told the clerk what he had won. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. "I thought she (the clerk) was going to fall over," he said. "She told me that ticket was the only Weekly Grand she had sold that day I bought it." McDonald told lottery officials he plans on buying some land and a home with his winnings and pay off some debts. "It's a real blessing," he added. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
