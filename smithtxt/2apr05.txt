Texas Lottery Commission Warns Public Against Internet Scam In Circulation
(Austin, April 29) - The Texas Lottery Commission wants the public to beware of an Internet scam currently in circulation that leads readers to believe they may have won a lottery prize. The subject title of the e-mail scam, "Claim Your Money," appears to be endorsed by the Texas Lottery® and several other world lotteries. "This e-mail is a delivery mechanism for malicious software that might include damaging computer viruses, spyware or other software. Opening any attachment or viewing any web site that is referenced in that e-mail will cause unnecessary risk to a person's computer or their personal information," said Texas Lottery Commission Information Resources Manager Joe Goebler. The e-mail looks authentic because it features the Texas Lottery logo and is signed by an alleged Texas Lottery Commission employee. The Texas Lottery does not notify players of prizes through use of e-mail. "This is just one more way for high-tech scam artists to take advantage of unsuspecting victims," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We want the public to be aware that this scam is going around, and not to be misled into believing a prize has been won through the Texas Lottery. Please, if someone receives this e-mail, immediately delete it. Do not open it."
