Birthday And Christmas Come Early For Fort Worth Texas Lottery® Winner

Desiree Walker claims her $100,000 prize for the Texas Lottery World Poker Tour scratch game.

(Austin, December 12) - Desiree Walker, who turns 21 years old on December 24, celebrated her birthday a little early this year. There wasn't much chance she would hold off until the actual day, since Friday evening she scratched her way to the top cash prize on the Texas Lottery® World Poker TourTM $100,000 Texas Hold 'EmTM scratch game. "My fiancé and I were home Friday night when I scratched the ticket," Walker explained. "I looked over at him and said, 'Justin, I believe we just won $100,000.' I started screaming and jumping up and down. I finally calmed down." Walker told lottery officials she wants to pay off some bills and get a new car. She also

said the two are making plans to set up an account for their 6-month-old baby boy. "It sounds like Ms. Walker has a lot worth celebrating," said Robert Heith, media relations director for the Texas Lottery Commission. "And for all our other Texas Hold 'Em scratch game fans, there are still two top prizes left unclaimed. That's cause for celebration right there." Walker purchased her top-prize winning ticket at RaceTrac #108 at 5310 N. Beach Street in Haltom City. The odds of winning a prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 3.04. Players may also enter to win a World Poker Tour prize package by mailing their nonwinning Texas Lottery® World Poker TourTM $100,000 Texas Hold 'EmTM scratch off tickets. There are two more 2nd chance drawings left for players to participate.
