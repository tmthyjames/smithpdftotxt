For Less Than The Cost Of A Vowel, Texas Lottery® Players Can Take A Turn On The Wheel of Fortune®

Ernest Stevenson of Lubbock won the first of 14 $25,000 top prizes for the Wheel of Fortune scratch-off game.

(Austin, February 25) - One of the world's most popular game shows is now available as a scratch-off ticket at Texas Lottery® retailers across the state. The new $2 Wheel of Fortune® instant game offers players a chance to win instant-cash prizes up to $25,000. In addition, players with non-winning tickets can enter a Second Chance Drawing for an opportunity to win one of four trips for two to Hollywood and an audition to be a contestant on the television version of Wheel of Fortune. "I think our players are really going to enjoy taking a spin on Wheel of Fortune," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "This game offers 'big money' cash prizes from $2 to $25,000, and the Second Chance Drawings mean even non-winning tickets could turn out to be a ticket to Hollywood, and maybe even an

appearance on the show." Wheel of Fortune debuted in 1975, and the syndicated show's hosts, Vanna White and Pat Sajak, continue to be welcomed into millions of North American homes every day. Now, Texas Lottery players can "turn" the letters for themselves. Earnest Stephenson of Lubbock took his turn already this week and won the first of the game's 14 $25,000 top prizes. "I scratched off the ticket just a few seconds after I bought it," Stephenson said. "I was really excited!" "Mr. Stephenson certainly didn't waste any time getting the Wheel of Fortune excitement started," said Greer. "And with millions of prizes remaining, Texas Lottery players can be sure that they're not going to 'lose a turn' at their own excitement." In addition to the $25,000 top prize, Wheel of Fortune offers instant prizes in the following amounts: $2,500, $1,000, $200, $100, $50, $25, $15, $10, $8, $5, $3 and $2. The odds of winning any prize are one in 4.65, including break-even prizes. Stephenson purchased his winning Wheel of Fortune ticket at Sunny's Food & Gas located at 10612 S. Kirkwood Rd. in Houston. The four Second Chance Drawings offer a total of 1,820 Wheel of Fortune merchandise prize packages (455 per drawing), as well as the four Wheel of Fortune audition trips (one per drawing), which include a four-day, three-night trip for two to Hollywood, California. Each trip includes airfare, one hotel room, transfers, hosting, two Wheel of Fortune merchandise prize packages, $1,000 in spending money and an audition for a chance to become a contestant on the Wheel of Fortune television game show. In the event an audition participant is selected to be a contestant on the Wheel of Fortune television game show, a three-day, two-night trip for two, including airfare, hotel and transfers will be provided. To enter a Second Chance Drawing, players must complete the player information on the back of two non-winning Texas Lottery Wheel of Fortune scratch-off tickets with their name, address, signature and telephone number and submit the entry by mail to Wheel of Fortune Second Chance Drawing, PO Box 650218, Dallas, TX 75265-0218.
