(Austin, July 22) - Charities across Texas can thank Charitable Bingo for providing them with distributions that totaled more than $7.6 million for the first quarter of 2005. "Once again, Charitable Bingo has proved itself the most charitable game in Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Charitable Bingo Director Billy Atkins. "Since 1982 when Charitable Bingo was legalized, charities across the state have received in excess of $780 million." Charitable distributions derived from bingo activities in Texas benefit a broad spectrum of tax-exempt organizations, from veteran groups to volunteer fire departments to libraries and numerous others. Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, the 1,292 organizations licensed to conduct charitable bingo games were required to report their distributions as charitable, religious, educational, exempt administrative or exempt social activity. The largest reported distribution went to charitable causes, followed by religious, exempt administrative expenses, educational and exempt social activities.
