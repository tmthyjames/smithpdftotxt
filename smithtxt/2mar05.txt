It's A Big Money Week At The Texas Lottery®; Two Big Grand Prize Winners In Two Days, And High Jackpot Prizes Up For Grabs
(Austin, March 29) - The Texas Lottery® is cranking out some big grand prize winners so far this week. Yesterday, Cary Beason Jr. of Houston claimed the top-cash prize for the Texas Lottery Monthly Bonus scratch-off game, $2.4 million, before taxes. Today, the commission handed out the $1 million top prize for Big Money Bonus Spectacular to Kelvin Johnson of Dallas. "We're on a roll with handing over some big money this month," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "So far this month, we've paid out more than $270 million to prize winners across the state." The Monthly Bonus scratch game pays out $10,000 a month for 20 years, up to $2,400,000. The Big Money Bonus Spectacular scratch game pays the $1 million prize in a single lump-sum payment. As of today, there is one top prize unclaimed in each of the scratch games. "Tonight there's another big Mega Millions jackpot up for grabs, $63 million," said Greer. "And tomorrow, the Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $31 million. We have the first and third highest jackpots offered in the nation, right now." Today's Big Money Bonus Spectacular winner has requested minimum publicity. The winning ticket was purchased at Tetco #659, located at 2435 W. Miller Road in Garland. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000.
