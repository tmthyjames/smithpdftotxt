Oklahoma Partnership Claims Mega MillionsTM 2nd-Tier Prize Of $175,000 From May 3 Drawing
(Austin, May 26) - D&S Investment Enterprises, L.L.C. of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, claimed a $175,000 prize from the May 3 Mega MillionsTM drawing. Darrell L. Arnold is a manager of the limited liability company. "My business partner and I don't miss an opportunity to buy tickets when we're here," Arnold said. "We'll have a lottery in Oklahoma soon, but I still buy tickets when I come here." Arnold said he and his business partner visit Texas once a month while conducting the newspaper-hauling enterprise they're engaged in. "They may not like our football teams, but they sure like our Lottery games up there on the other side of the Red River," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We get players from all over the map, and this one certainly isn't the first winner to come from our friendly neighbor state of Oklahoma." Arnold said that he plans to use his share to pay off some of his debts and that he'll continue to play the Games of Texas. "I'm probably going to buy tickets in Denton again on my way home," he said. The ticket was purchased at the Albertson's #4152, located at 2321 W. University in Albertson's in Denton. The ticket matched five numbers minus the bonus ball. Those numbers were 46-42-17-752, and the bonus number was 47. Claimants have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim a prize. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $425,000. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $80 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $5 million.
