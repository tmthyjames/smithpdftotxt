PULL TABS CONTINUE TO CREATE SALES FOR CHARITIES AND NON-PROFITS IN CHARITABLE BINGO
(AUSTIN, October 28) - (AUSTIN) ­ In the autumn of 2002, new pull-tab games, called event pull-tab games, went on sale at bingo halls across the state and became a major success for non-profits that conduct charitable bingo games. What are event pull-tab games? These are games that include the same feature of regular pull-tab games, but incorporate a second level of play that provides an additional opportunity to win. Event pull-tab ticket winners are determined by some subsequent action such as the drawing of a bingo ball(s), or the spinning of a wheel--actions that add interest and excitement to the games. These pull-tabs were approved by administrative rule for sale in Texas at the end of the third quarter of 2002 "We received meaningful comments and suggestions from the bingo industry on the administrative rule, which they enthusiastically supported," said Billy Atkins, director of the Charitable Bingo Operations Division of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Once authorized, we noticed a huge jump in sales of more than $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2003, which is something we have not seen in the past. Pull-tab sales had been declining every year from 1991 to 2001." Every year since then, there have been bigger and bigger gross sales of pull-tabs, according to Atkins. "From 2002 to 2004, sales of pull-tabs have more than doubled," he said. Pull-tab sales for the first two quarters of 2005 exceeded pull-tab sales for the same quarters of 2004 by more than $26 million. It means players really like the prizes these event pull tabs offer, and the non-profits also benefit by having happy players." The following chart demonstrates how pull-tab sales and prizes have grown since 2002. The figure for 2001 is included for comparison purposes.
