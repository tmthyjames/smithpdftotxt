Persistence Pays Off: Longtime San Antonio Player Collects $30,543 Cash FiveTM Prize

Max A. Konz Jr. of San Antonio collected $30,543 for matching all five numbers in the September 19 Cash Five drawing.

(Austin, September 29) - Max A. Konz Jr. is a regular visitor to the Texas Lottery® claim center in San Antonio; he's been playing the Games of Texas regularly since the lottery's inception in 1992 and has won as much as $1,000 more than once. However, last Friday he walked out of the claim center with his biggest prize ever ­ $30,543 ­ for winning the top prize in the September 19 Cash FiveTM drawing. "I love all of the games, especially Cash Five; I'd play it eight days a week if I could," said Konz. "I really just play for fun, but it sure is a lot more fun when you win like this!" Konz, who is retired, said he planned to donate some of his winnings to his church, pay

off some bills and maybe share a little with his grandchildren, but his first priority was to buy some more Texas Lottery tickets. "A lot of our winners say 'you can't win if you don't play' and that philosophy certainly seems to have worked out well for Mr. Konz," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "And with drawings six nights a week, along with MultiDraw and Advance Play features, Cash Five is a great option for our regular players."
