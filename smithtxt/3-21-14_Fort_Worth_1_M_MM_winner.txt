FORT WORTH FRIENDS WIN MORE THAN $1 MILLION ON MEGA MILLIONS® TICKET
(AUSTIN) ­ Felicia Hinton of Fort Worth and three friends traveled to the Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim a Mega Millions® ticket worth $1,000,002 on behalf of a group of 21 friends. The Quick Pick ticket purchased at the 7-Eleven Convenience Store #36031, located at 4401 Golden Triangle Blvd. in Fort Worth, won twice on two separate lines. Their ticket was the only one in Texas to match all five numbers (9-14-56-57-69) but not the Mega Ball (10) for $1 million. It was also one of more than 57,000 to match one number plus the Mega Ball.

"We've played Mega Millions before, but only a couple of times with this group," explained Hinton. "We have 21 people in the group, and we're claiming the prize on the 21st."

Hinton saw that the jackpot hadn't been hit, so she didn't bother to check her tickets until the next night.

"I went and scanned the tickets. We were winning $1 here and $2 there. Then I scanned this ticket and it said to contact the Lottery Commission," said Hinton. "I asked the clerk, `What does that mean?' He said, `That means you won at least $1,000.' So, I kept scanning the rest of the tickets."

It wasn't until another customer recommended that she check the numbers that Hinton had her first clue to the amount won. "I had no idea what it meant, but I knew it must be good," said Hinton.

Hinton checked txlottery.org and discovered that the "match five" prize was $1 million. She sent the information to her friends, but no one believed it until they checked for themselves. Hinton describes the win as "truly a blessing."

Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to 15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
