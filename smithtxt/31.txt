HUMBLE AREA RETAILER RECEIVES BONUS - NO WORD FROM LOTTO TEXAS TICKET HOLDER
(Austin, August 2) - Who says the number "13" is unlucky? For Copperfield Liquor #6 in Humble, a lucky $13 million Lotto Texas jackpot-winning ticket means a one-percent bonus of $130,000. "We've always dreamed of selling a winning ticket," said Copperfield owner, Gary Hmaidan. "We consider selling lottery tickets a convenient service to the people in our area. Our luck finally came through." The Humble store, located at 7540 FM 1960 East, sold the sole winning ticket for the June 23rd Lotto Texas drawing. There has been no word from the ticket holder. Hmaidan told lottery officials he returned the favor of his store employees selling the winning ticket by giving them a bonus of their own. He paid each of them one-percent of the bonus, and hopes the incentive will help to promote lottery sales at his nine other locations. Houston area retailers have had quite a bit of luck this year with selling jackpot-winning Lotto Texas tickets. With the addition of this retailer, there have been four retailers altogether in the Houston-area that sold a top-prize winning Lotto ticket. The RDK Revocable Trust of Houston claimed the sole jackpot-winning Lotto Texas ticket for $23 million from January 27th. The ticket was purchased at Randall's located at 12555 Westheimer in Houston. There was a $21 million winning Lotto ticket sold on June 9th at K & K Food Mart, located at 1738 S. Dairy Ashford. The Elizondo Family Trust of Houston claimed the jackpot on June 29th. Finally, the A&L Postal Services, on 5170 Aldine Mail Route, sold the $13 million ticket for the Saturday, July 7th Lotto Texas drawing. The CSF Partnership of Houston claimed the prize on July 20th. "As a token for all the hard work that Copperfield Liquor has done, I'm happy to present this ceremonial check for $130,000 to show how much we appreciate their enthusiasm and dedication to the Texas Lottery Commission," said Texas Lottery representative, Renè McCoy. "Of course, we also want to congratulate them for selling a top-prize winning Lotto Texas ticket!" Since the inception of Lotto Texas in November 1992, there have been 117 Houston area lottery retailers who have sold 119 jackpot-winning tickets. The bonus amount paid to those retailers totals more than $12.3 million. ....
