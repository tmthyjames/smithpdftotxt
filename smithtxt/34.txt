LOTTO TEXAS MATRIX CHANGE ONE YEAR AGO BROUGHT BIG FUN, BIGGER JACKPOTS
(Austin, July 20) - One year ago, the Texas Lottery Commission changed the matrix of the Lotto Texas game, generating big excitement and even bigger jackpots for the six-of-six game. "What we did was change the game to make the jackpots larger, which is what the players really indicated to us they wanted," said Tom Clowe, Chairman of the Texas Lottery Commission. "These games are for the people of Texas and any of our neighbors who want to play. In retrospect, the change to the matrix of Lotto Texas has been a positive one, and one that the players are accepting and are liking." Before the change, players attempted to match six-of-50 numbers for a minimum jackpot prize of $4 million. The odds of winning the top prize were one in 15.8 million. Once the change took place on July 16, 2000, players chose six numbers from a field of 54, and the odds of winning the jackpot changed to one in 25.8 million. "While the odds of winning the top prize increased, we also increased the prize levels," Clowe said. "The amount of cash we return to our Lotto Texasplayers in prizes jumped from 50 percent to 55 percent of total Lotto sales." Clowe said players and retailers had long been asking for higher jackpots and bigger prizes. The average prize for a five-of-six is now $2,500, $105 for a four-of six ticket, and a guaranteed $5 for matching three numbers. During the first 45 weeks of the current fiscal year, average weekly Lotto Texassales of have increased by nearly 30 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. There are 15,600 Lotto Texasretailers, with an additional 1,100 who sell only instant tickets. A comparison of the sales information before and after the change shows the following: 102 drawings before the 6/54 change: 102 drawings after the 6/54 change: Total sales: $558,803,922 Total Sales: $706,532,520 Avg.

The roll to the record level began with the $4 million prize on January 31st and kept going until March 7th. The lone winning ticket was sold in Austin, and claimed by RBH CNC Ltd., also of Austin. "The excitement generated by the biggest-ever Lotto jackpot also helped us break our one-day sales record," Clowe said. "We sold more than $32.1 million the day of the drawing. We hope to see these jackpots continue to grow and the people of Texas continue to enjoy playing the Games of Texas." .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time."
