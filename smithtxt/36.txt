IT WAS A FIRST! PICK 3 PLAYERS VISIT LOTTERY'S TV STUDIO WHERE THEY WATCH THEIR LUCKY NUMBERS GET PICKED DURING LIVE DRAWING
(Austin, July 20) - It begs the question; what are the odds? Rose Belizare and her fiancé, Greg Mitchell of Houston, were visiting the Capital City on a business trip. The couple planned to view a live Texas Lottery drawing while they were in town. "Pick 3 is my favorite game," said Rose Belizare. "I have a lot of fun trying to figure out what numbers are going to be called up." They arrived an hour before the drawing and watched the final preparations to conduct the games for Thursday, June 28th, Cash 5 and Pick 3. "The drawings team explained everything they had to do before the draw could take place," Belizare said. "We joked that if our numbers came up, we wouldn't be able to jump for joy or make any noise." Try to imagine their surprise, their utter disbelief, as they watched their numbers, 5-4-3, pop up the chutes of the Pick 3 drawings machine in the exact order they chose them. "Greg told me my numbers had come up, and even though I could see them, it was too much to believe," she said. "Even the camera crew couldn't believe what they were seeing." It's easy to see why Belizare is partial to Pick 3. She won $1,500 a few months ago, and picked up another $250 the night of the June 28th draw. There have been other Pick 3 prizes as well over the last few years. Pick 3 is a daily game that offers a 50-cent play, six drawings per week and a top prize of $500 on a $1 play. Players select three numbers each from 0 to 9, and may play the three digits in four different ways: exact order, any order, exact/any order or combo. Since its inception in 1993, Pick 3 sales have surpassed the $1 billion mark, and represent 4.7 percent of the total Texas Lottery sales. By the way, according to the Lottery's independent statistician, Dr. Randy Eubank, the odds of this happening again are exactly the same as the odds of selecting any exact-order Pick 3 winning combination: 1 in 1,000. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
