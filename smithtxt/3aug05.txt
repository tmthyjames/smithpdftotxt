Lubbock Man Says Texas Lottery® I Love Lucy® Scratch Ticket A Lucky Game For Him

Lubbock resident Richard Moreno says he prefers the I Love Lucy instant ticket; it netted him the top prize of $20,000.

(Austin, August 26) - It took more than a week for Richard Moreno to collect his Texas Lottery® prize, and according to him, since his lucky I LOVE LUCY® ticket netted him $20,000, he and his wife are now going to have a little fun. "We've been really lucky with the I LOVE LUCY ticket; winning $200 on one and $50 on another," said Moreno. "Now, it has really paid off, and we can do a few back flips." Introduced to lottery players in July, the I LOVE LUCY® scratch game features America's favorite redhead, Lucille Ball, and a top cash prize of $20,000. Moreno told lottery officials he plans to use his winnings to pay off some bills, fix up his truck a little, and "share most of it with my wife."

"This ticket has been extremely popular with our players across the state," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "As of August 20th, ticket sales for the game have exceeded $8.1 million and overall instant ticket sales total more than $2.6 billion, up 16.36% percent over this same time last year." The $2 ticket I LOVE LUCY® scratch game features five different scenes with Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel in some of the funniest moments in television history. Players can win cash prizes from $2 to $20,000. As of today, there are still eight top prizes left to claim. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.25. Moreno purchased his winning ticket at EZ Mart #241, located at 4426 34th Street in Lubbock.
