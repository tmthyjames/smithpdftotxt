Texas Lottery Commission Financial Reporting Again Garners National Accolades
(Austin, December 5) - The Office of the Controller of the Texas Lottery Commission has been awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for Fiscal Year 2004. The prestigious national award is the highest form of recognition in the area of governmental accounting and financial reporting, and its attainment represents a significant accomplishment by a government agency and its management. "All of us at the Texas Lottery share a commitment to excellence and this recognition for our Office of the Controller is just one indication of how that commitment is paying off," said Gary Grief, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. According to a statement released by GFOA, "The Texas Lottery Commission CAFR has been judged by an impartial panel to meet the high standards of the program, including demonstrating a constructive 'spirit of full disclosure' to clearly communicate its financial story and motivate potential users and user groups to read the CAFR." This is the third consecutive year that the Texas Lottery Office of the Controller has been recognized by GFOA, a nonprofit professional association with offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C. GFOA serves approximately 16,000 government finance professionals.
