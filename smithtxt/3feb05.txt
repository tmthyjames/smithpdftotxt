Big Win In A Small Town ­ Dime Box Resident Claims $50,000 Cash Zone Top Prize

Jason Weidemann of Dime Box won $50,000, the top prize in the Cash Zone scratch-off game.

(Austin, February 24) - Jason Weidemann of Dime Box, population 313, enjoys Texas Lottery® scratch-off games so much that his wife was once reluctant to send him into the store for a soda, knowing he'd likely return with a lottery ticket, as well. She had a

change of attitude on Saturday though, when Weidemann emerged from the store holding a top-prize winning Cash Zone ticket worth $50,000! "I've always liked playing scratch-offs, but my wife didn't always approve," said Weidemann. "I don't think she'll mind too much anymore, though." Weidemann said the $5 scratch-off games like Cash Zone are his favorites, but the most he'd ever won before was $200. He plans to use his winnings to pay off some bills and take his wife on a vacation. "I want to wish Mr. Weidemann and his wife a great vacation," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Mr. Weidemann's win is proof that top-prize winning Texas Lottery tickets can pop up anywhere, from our biggest cities to our smaller communities like Dime Box." Weidemann purchased his winning Cash Zone ticket at the K&C Quick Stop located at 4293 East Hwy 21 in Dime Box.
