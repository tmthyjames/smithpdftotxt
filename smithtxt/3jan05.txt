Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing Worth More Than $730,000 To Texas Players
(Austin, January 27) - Statewide, Texas Mega MillionsTM players picked enough of the numbers drawn in Tuesday night's drawing to make their tickets worth $730,283. Included in that total were five tickets that matched four of five numbers plus the Mega Ball, good enough for $5,000 each, and one ticket that matched five of five numbers. The buyer of that ticket also purchased the MegaplierTM option, which raised the winning value from $175,000 to $525,000! "Congratulations to everyone holding tickets matching the numbers from Tuesday night's drawing. They are a great illustration of why Mega Millions is such a popular game here in Texas and the other 10 participating states," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I also want to remind everyone to play the Games of Texas responsibly; it only takes one ticket to win!" Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 52, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 52. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $10 million and increases until it is won. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times by matching one additional number. Since no tickets matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in Tuesday's drawing, Friday's Mega Millions jackpot will be worth an estimated $18 million.
