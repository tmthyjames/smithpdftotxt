No Cookie, No Problem ­ Houston Monthly Bonus Player Settles For $10,000 A Month For 20 Years

(Austin, March 29) - Cary Beason Jr. of Houston yesterday claimed the top prize ­ $10,000 a month for 20 years ­ in the Texas Lottery® Monthly Bonus scratch-off game. The total amount of the prize before taxes is $2,400,000. "I really stopped by the store just to buy a cookie," said Beason. "They didn't have the kind I wanted, but I picked up a couple of scratch-off tickets anyway. I feel very lucky that this has happened to me." "Mr. Beason can certainly afford to stock up on cookies now," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Even though Mr. Beason has claimed his winnings, there is still a grand prize remaining for some lucky player who could use a $10,000 Monthly Bonus for the next 20 years!" The winning ticket was purchased at Today's Food Mart, located at 7558 Bellfort St. in Houston. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. The winner requested minimal publicity. In addition to the two top prizes, the $5 Monthly Bonus game offers cash prizes in

amounts ranging from $5 to $20,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org ... The Texas Lottery supports public education by contributing to the Foundation School Fund.
