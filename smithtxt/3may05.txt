Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing Worth More Than A Million For Texas Players
(Austin, May 25) - Though no tickets sold for last night's Mega MillionsTM drawing matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball, Texas players statewide matched enough numbers to make their tickets worth a combined $1,175,429. Two tickets, sold in San Angelo and Tyler, matched five of five numbers. The buyer of the ticket in San Angelo also purchased the MegaplierTM option, which increased the prize value from $175,000 to $700,000! Two other tickets sold in Texas matched four of five numbers, worth $5,000, and one of those players also Megaplied, increasing the value of the ticket to $20,000. "Mega Millions offers multiple ways to win and last night more than 47,000 Texas players did just that," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The Megaplier only adds to the excitement for Texas players, as I'm sure one lucky ticket-holder in San Angelo can attest." Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 52, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 52. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times. The numbers from last night's drawing were 45-39-28-40-9, the Mega Ball was 24, and the Megaplier was 4. Since no tickets matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in Tuesday's drawing, Friday's Mega Millions jackpot will be worth an estimated $80 million.
