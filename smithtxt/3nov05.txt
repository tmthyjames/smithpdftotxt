Following Lead Of A Fellow Lottery Player Gives Waco Resident Reason To Celebrate

Matthew Gaskamp of Waco has reasons to smile - he claimed the top cash prize of $55,000 for the Texas Lottery Lucky 5's scratch off game.

(Austin, November 30) - While waiting in line at the Smart Stop #41, at 8309 North Highway 6 in Waco, Matt Gaskamp noticed the gentleman in front of him was buying a few Texas Lottery® LUCKY 5's scratch games. When it came his turn to pay up for his drink, he decided to follow suit and bought one of the $5 tickets. "I scratched it right there and saw that I might have won," said Gaskamp. "I had the clerk run the ticket through the machine to make sure. Then I went home and just sat on the couch looking at it. I couldn't believe it." Gaskamp's ticket netted him the top cash prize, $55,000. He told lottery officials that he plans to put the majority of his winnings in the bank. The 21-year-old is currently

attending Temple Junior College and said he may use some of the money to help pay for tuition. "Supporting education is our number one mission at the Texas Lottery," said Robert Tirloni, products manager of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Whether it's a winner using his or her winnings to pay for college, or the part of every dollar spent on lottery games that is transferred to the Foundation School Fund, we're happy to know that the money is being used to help the future of Texas."
