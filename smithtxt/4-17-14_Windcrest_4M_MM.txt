WINDCREST PARTNERSHIP WINS TWICE ON ONE MEGA MILLIONS® TICKET AND CLAIMS $4,002,000 PRIZE
(AUSTIN) ­ The August E. Moore & Denise L. Moore, Limited Liability Limited Partnership, by August E. Moore, First Partner, of Windcrest claimed a Mega Millions® ticket worth $4,002,000 from the drawing held Friday, Jan. 17.

The Right Choice Food Mart #9 at 8011 Midcrown Drive in San Antonio sold the ticket.

The trust's ticket was the only one in Texas to match all five numbers drawn (1-10-26-31-51) but not the Mega Ball (11). Normally, this would make the trust eligible to claim a $1 million prize, but their decision to add the Megaplier® option at the time of purchase quadrupled their second-tier prize to $4 million. The trust also won an additional $2,000 on the same ticket. Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to
15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega

Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
