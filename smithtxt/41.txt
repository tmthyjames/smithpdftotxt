TEXAS TWO STEP WINNER BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF - TURNS OVER TICKET WORTH $366,666
(Austin, July 9) - - It's been a nerve-wracking week, according to Sandra Wilson of Sante Fe, Texas. Wilson won $366,666 for the July 3rd Texas Two Step drawing worth a total $1.1 million. The ticket was one of three matching all numbers plus the Bonus Ball. "My stomach has been in knots," said Wilson. "I kept asking my husband if he was sure he knew where the ticket was." Wilson said her husband put the jackpot-winning ticket in a watermelon shaped jar in the kitchen for safekeeping. She admitted to checking on it a few times, just to make sure it was still there. According to Wilson, she and her husband were watching KTRK TV (ABC) Channel 13 in Houston the following morning after the drawing, and saw the numbers come up on their television screen. She couldn't believe she had the same numbers, so she sent her husband down to the nearest convenience store to check. "He came back to the house screaming," Wilson said. "We thought it was only for $200,000 until the clerk at the store told my husband what we had really won." When asked if she had any immediate plans for the money, Sandy said, "I've been renting all my life, now I'm buying my own home! "And I'm paying cash," she added. The jackpot winning Quick Pick ticket was purchased at Amigo Mart, located at 14325 Highway 6 in Santa Fe. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $3,333.33. Bonuses are split among retailers when there are multiple winning tickets. Wilson also said she buys most of her lottery tickets at this location, and likes to play all the games. "I think Texas Two Step is my favorite now though," Wilson replied. The other two tickets were purchased in Houston and Dallas. One ticket was bought at Richland Texaco, located at 9301 LBJ Freeway in Dallas, and was also claimed today by Billy Lynn of Coppell. The other ticket was bought at the First Stop Food Store, located at 9230 Buffalo Speedway in Houston and remains unclaimed. This Texas Two Step jackpot marks the second time it has gone over the $1 million point. The first $1.1 million jackpot was on Friday, June 15th and was claimed by Seven Aces from Corpus Christi. The Texas Two Step jackpot for Tuesday's drawing is $200,000. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time."
