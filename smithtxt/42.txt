THE SEVEN ACES STRIKE IT BIG; PARTNERSHIP COLLECTS $1.1 MILLION TEXAS TWO STEP PRIZE
(Austin, July 5) - Lottery players in Corpus Christi have taken a shine to the Texas Lottery's newest game, Texas Two Step. Within one month, two top-tier Texas Two Step prizes have been won by residents of the sparkling city by the bay. The Texas Lottery Commission today presented the Seven Aces, a partnership of seven friends from Corpus Christi, with a ceremonial check in the amount of $1.1 million. The partnership purchased the lone winning ticket for the Texas Two Step drawing on Friday, June 15th. The winning Quick Pick ticket was purchased at Ace Mart, 4750 Leopard Street. For selling the winning ticket, the store is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, which comes to $10,000. The winning numbers were 07-24-25-20, with 35 the bonus ball number. The Seven Aces are the second group of work mates employed at the city's Army Depot to win a large Texas Lottery prize. The Ramp Rats, another partnership, won a Cash Value Option prize of $6.4 million on May 10th, 2000, playing Lotto Texas. "We've been buying two tickets each for practically every drawing of Lotto and now with Texas Two Step," said Mario Garza, managing partner of the Seven Aces. "We kid around a lot, so when one of the guys told me we had won, naturally I didn't believe him. In fact, one of the other guys thought the jackpot had been $91,000, and we had to straighten him out when we all finally got together the Tuesday after the drawing. Was he ever surprised!" A Corpus Christi resident was one of the three winners for the first Texas Two Step drawing on May 18th. Barbara Smart received a prize of $91,258. She purchased her ticket at Lozano Liquor Store, 5133 Kostoryz, Suite C, in Corpus. The winner requested minimal publicity. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $13 million. ....
