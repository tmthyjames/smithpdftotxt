HOUSTON LOTTO TEXAS WINNER CLAIMS $21 MILLION JACKPOT PRIZE
(Austin, June 29) - The Texas Lottery Commission today presented the Elizondo Family Trust with a ceremonial check in the amount of $11,646,801.60 for matching the six winning numbers in the Lotto Texas $21 million drawing on June 9th, 2001 Omar Elizondo of Houston is the trustee. The winning Quick Pick ticket was purchased with a Cash Value Option, which gives the winner the net present value of the jackpot, approximately half of the advertised jackpot. For selling the winning ticket, the K and K Mart located at 1738 S. Dairy Ashford is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, which comes to $210,000. The winning numbers were 6-12-48-28-43-47. Elizondo did not learn until the Monday after the Saturday drawing what the winning numbers were because all newscasts were focused on reporting the extensive flooding caused by Tropical Storm Allison. "I matched up the winning numbers Monday morning at work," Elizondo said. "Then I walked into my boss's office with my hands shaking and showed him my ticket. He was happy for me, and then he sent me home." The winner requested minimal publicity. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $6 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
