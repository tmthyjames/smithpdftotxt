QUINLAN LOTTO TEXAS WINNER PUTS HER WINNINGS INTO DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION
(Austin, June 25) - After claiming her Lotto Texas jackpot worth an estimated $4 million, Christie Barnes of Quinlan said she knew exactly what she was going to do with the money from the April 25 drawing. "I want to provide for my little girl's future," said Barnes. "I'm going to set up something for her education." Since Barnes chose the Cash Value Option, she'll have more than $2.2 million to invest in her daughter's future. Barnes received a ceremonial check from Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud today in Austin. The winning ticket was a Quick Pick. The numbers were: 2-3-27-34-48-50. Barnes bought the ticket from the One Stop Food Store, located at the junction of Highway 35 and Highway 34 in Quinlan. One Stop Foods, Inc., the corporate owner of the Quinlan store, has already received its one-percent bonus of $40,000, and gave its employees a share of the award. Barnes has requested minimum publicity, noting that she hasn't told that many people. "It took me three weeks just to tell my best friend," she said. "When I stopped by One Stop one night to buy gas, everyone was talking about the winning ticket," she explained. "After some customers left, I went up to the sales girl and asked if she could keep a secret. Then I told her 'I have the winning ticket.' " The clerk told Barnes that "It couldn't have happened to a nicer person." Barnes' daughter isn't the only one whose education will benefit from Lottery money. The Texas Lottery has contributed more than $8 billion to the Foundation School Fund since the Texas Legislature earmarked lottery revenue for that purpose in 1997. The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's drawing is $4 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
