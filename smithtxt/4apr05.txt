Texas-Sized Jackpot For Friday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing An Estimated $205 Million!

The jackpot for Friday's Mega Millions drawing will be an estimated $205 million!

(Austin, April 20) - Since no tickets matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in last night's Mega MillionsTM drawing, the jackpot for Friday's drawing will be an estimated $205 million. Three tickets sold in Texas matched five of five numbers, worth $175,000 each. Five tickets sold in Texas matched four of five numbers plus the Mega Ball, good for $5,000, and one of those lucky players tripled their prize by purchasing the MegaplierTM option. Overall, more than 97,000 winning tickets, worth more than $1 million, were sold in Texas. "The 97,331 winning tickets sold in Texas for last night's drawing show that Mega Millions excitement has spread throughout the state," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. Mega Millions is currently played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In February, officials in California announced plans to join the fun later this year. The Texas Lottery® marked its first full year of participation in Mega Millions on December 3, 2004. Mega Millions sales in Texas currently total more than $357 million, with over $141 million of that amount going to the state's Foundation School Fund. "Nothing would make me happier than to see Friday's $205 million jackpot stay here in

Texas, just like the $112 million jackpot won in Rowlett on March 1," said Greer. "But I also want to remind everyone who enjoys the Games of Texas to play responsibly, and remember, it's just a game!" Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 52, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 52. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $10 million and increases until it is won. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times.
