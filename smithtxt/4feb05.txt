(Austin, February 23) - Charities across Texas can thank Charitable Bingo for bringing them distributions that total in excess of three-quarters of a billion dollars during the last 23 years.

"With the almost-$30 million in distributions that were made in calendar year 2004, the total that charities have received since 1982 is now more than $773.6 million." Charitable distributions derived from bingo activities in Texas benefit a broad spectrum of charities, from veteran groups to volunteer fire departments to libraries and numerous others.
