What's Not To 'Love' About Texas Lottery® Newest Scratch Game
(Austin, July 20) - America's favorite redhead has made it to Texas. The I LOVE LUCY® scratch game, from the Texas Lottery® will certainly strike a chord with players wanting to 'wax nostalgic' for the infectious smile, the comical faces and the wild predicaments that made Lucille Ball a comedic icon. "It could also strike a special place in their wallets, if their tickets reveal the top cash prize of $20,000," said Texas Lottery Commission Products Manager Robert Tirloni. Starting July 20, players can purchase the $2 I LOVE LUCY® scratch game, featuring five different scenes with Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel in some of the funniest moments in television history. The I LOVE LUCY® scratch game features cash prizes from $2 to $20,000. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.25. "We're so excited presenting the I LOVE LUCY® scratch game to our Texas players," said Tirloni. "Lucy was truly an exceptional entertainer and this ticket really brings back those fond memories of her. It makes the I LOVE LUCY® scratch game seem that much more fun to play when you see the scenes on the tickets and remember the old television shows we have all come to love."
