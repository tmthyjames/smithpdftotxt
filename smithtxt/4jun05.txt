New Mega MillionsTM Game Starts Tomorrow And A Chance To Win Up To $1 Million
(Austin, June 21) - Starting 6 a.m. tomorrow, players get their chance to play the new Mega MillionsTM game, and that means they also could win up to $1 million without even hitting the jackpot. "The new Mega Millions game offers some really exciting features for players in Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "For starters, the second-tier prize changed to $250,000, up from $175,000, and the third-tier prize level goes up from $5,000 to $10,000. For anyone purchasing a Mega Millions ticket in Texas, and choosing to play the Megaplier feature, too, it could mean multiplying that $250,000 prize up to a $1 million prize instead." Players will select five numbers from 1 to 56 and then a Mega Ball number from a second field of 1 to 46. Each play costs $1. To win the jackpot prize, a player must match all five numbers and the Mega Ball for the drawing. Jackpots will start at $12 million. Drawings will continue to be held every Tuesday and Friday evening. Overall odds of winning are 1 in 40. Odds of winning the jackpot prize are 1 in 175.7 million. For an extra dollar per play, players can choose the Megaplier feature. The feature, played only in Texas, allows players the chance to increase their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings by 2, 3 or 4 times. The changes came after the California Lottery announced in February plans to become the 12th participating state to join the multi-state game. The new Mega Millions game is projected to generate more than $67 million in additional revenue to the state of Texas from sales for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2005 through Fiscal Year 2009. Since joining Mega Millions in 2003, ticket sales have topped more than $400 million (amount includes Megaplier sales). "In addition to the fun of the game, there's the good feeling of knowing that the revenue from Mega Millions ticket sales in Texas goes to the Foundation School Fund to support Texas education," said Greer. After tonight's drawing, Mega Millions will be played in the following 12 states: California,

Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Washington. Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $31 million. If there are no tickets matching the first five numbers and the Mega Ball for tonight's drawing, the estimated jackpot for Friday's drawing will be worth $42 million.
