Austin Texas Two Step® Player One Big Step Closer To New Home After $825,000 Jackpot

Austin's Julia Garcia won $825,000 in the October 10, 2005, Texas Two Step drawing.

(Austin, October 17) - Austin's Julia Garcia is not a regular Texas Two Step® player, but while on a weekend trip to the coast, she got a hunch when she noticed that the jackpot for the Texas Lottery® game had climbed to $825,000. Garcia's hunch paid off when one of the five tickets she purchased matched all four numbers plus the Bonus Ball, making her the sole winner of last Monday's Texas Two Step jackpot. "I don't usually play Texas Two Step, but when I pulled over for gas, I just had a feeling," said Garcia. "When I saw that I won on Monday night, I just freaked out; it's still really hard to believe, but it's also really exciting."

Garcia said she wasn't sure what she would do with all of her winnings, but she's definitely planning to buy a house with some of the money. "Playing a hunch is as good a way to win as any when you play the Games of Texas and it certainly paid off for Ms. Garcia," said Bobby Heith, director of media relations for the Texas Lottery Commission. "The one thing we know for sure is that you can't win if you don't play!" Texas Two Step features drawings on Mondays and Thursdays, with jackpots starting at $200,000. The numbers for last Monday night's drawing were 8 ­ 25 ­ 30 ­ 35 and the Bonus Ball was 34. Garcia purchased her matching ticket at the Ayers City Stop, located at 5220 Ayers St. in Corpus Christi. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $8,250 for selling the winning ticket.
