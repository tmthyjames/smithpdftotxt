Bastrop Man Claims $4.4 Million Lotto Texas® Prize
(Austin, September 19) - Clay E. Buckland of Bastrop today claimed $4.4 million, the cash value option amount for the $6 million Lotto Texas® jackpot drawing held Saturday, September 17. "A cash value prize, like the $4.4 million Lotto prize from Saturday's drawing, creates excitement for our players and claimants" said Robert Heith, media relations director at the Texas Lottery. "And I'm sure that's why Mr. Buckland wasted no time in getting to Lottery headquarters to pick up his prize. This claim makes Mr. Buckland winner number 492 of a Lotto Texas jackpot." Buckland found out he had the ticket that matched the numbers drawn on Sunday morning at the store where he purchased it. "I checked my ticket at the Jet-Stop Sunday when I went in to buy a sausage on a stick and some orange juice," he said. "The clerk ran it through and told me I had to come to Austin to pick up my prize. I knew I had at least some of the numbers." Buckland's ticket matched the five numbers plus the Bonus Ball number. Those numbers as drawn were 42-37-23-39-8, and the Bonus Ball number was 3. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased at the Jet-Stop, 1206 S. Colorado, in Lockhart. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot, capped at $500,000. For this claim, that amount is $60,000. The claimant requested minimal publicity. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $250,000. Tomorrow night's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
