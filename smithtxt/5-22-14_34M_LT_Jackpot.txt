LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT REACHES HIGHEST LEVEL IN YEARS!
Texas Lottery players vying for two of the top five jackpots nationwide
(AUSTIN) ­ With no jackpot-winning tickets sold Wednesday, the Lotto Texas® jackpot rolled to an estimated, annuitized $34.75 million for Saturday's drawing. This is the highest jackpot for the Texas Lottery's® flagship game since May 2010. It is also currently the fourth largest jackpot available anywhere in the United States.

Lotto Texas has been a favorite game for players from the first drawing held Nov. 14, 1992, just six months after the official Texas Lottery launch. It is Texas' original jackpot game and continues to contribute to the Lottery's overall sales, which reached record levels last year. In addition to the Lotto Texas jackpot, the multi-state Powerball® drawing for Saturday will feature an estimated, annuitized jackpot of $132 million. At that level, it is the highest jackpot available nationwide, making Texans among the luckiest lottery players in the world this week!
