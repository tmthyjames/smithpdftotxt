GUN BARREL CITY LOTTO TEXAS WINNER CLAIMS $26 MILLION JACKPOT
(Austin, May 16) - Imagine waking up one morning, realizing you may have just won the jackpot for Lotto Texas, and not even know how big the jackpot was. "Usually we watch the drawings on television before the news," said Ginny Ennis of Ennis Ventures Limited Partnership. "But it just so happened I didn't see them until the following morning, and I knew right away those were my numbers." Ennis explained she woke her husband, Gary, and told him "We won the lottery." "We didn't even know how much it was," he said. "I knew it had to be a least $4 million. When we did finally find out the amount was $26 million, we couldn't believe we were the only winners." According to the partners, the two play the same numbers all the time, with the exception of each year two of the numbers change to correspond with his age and the number of years they have been married. They have been married 16 years. The winning numbers were: 26-50-16-05-04-43. "The numbers were about to change," explained Gary. "My birthday fell on the following week after the drawing. Number '43' was about to be number '44.'" The Texas Lottery presented a ceremonial check for $14,493,887.20 to the partnership earlier today. The winner chose the Cash Value Option, which pays a one-time installment equaling approximately half of the estimated jackpot amount. The jackpot-winning ticket was purchased at Food Fast #63, located at 2209 W. Main in Gun Barrel City. Earlier today, the retailer received a bonus of one-percent of the estimated jackpot amount, which totaled $260,000. Representatives of the partnership have requested minimum publicity. The jackpot for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing is an estimated $22 million. ....
