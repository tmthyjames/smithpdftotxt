SALE OF RECORD $85 MILLION LOTTO TICKET PLACES AUSTIN RETAILER IN HALF MILLION CLUB
(Austin, May 16) - There aren't many members in this select club of retailers. In fact, until now, there were only three members of the Texas Lottery's "Retailer Half Million Club." Today, Shoppers Mart #24 on North Lamar Boulevard, one of 33 Triple S Petroleum stores in Austin, became the latest retailer to join this select group. Texas Lottery officials presented Triple S Petroleum representatives Allen Smith, one of the 'S's' in Triple S, area supervisor Joe Hays, Triple S general manager Billy McNamara, and acting store manager Marvin Bailey, with a ceremonial check for half-a-million dollars for selling the winning ticket for the record $85 million Lotto Texas jackpot in March. "This was without a doubt one of the most exciting times we've ever had at the Lottery," Cloud said. "This was the biggest jackpot in the Texas Lottery's history, and this retailer has earned $500,000 - the biggest bonus we offer our retailers." According to Cloud, tickets were going at more than 64,000 per minute, just over 1,000 per second, at the peak of sales the day of the March 7 drawing. Also attending today's check presentation were Beverly and Robert Chody, who represent the RBH CNC, Ltd. Partnership that claimed the Cash Value Option prize of $51.2 million. Beverly Chody purchased the sole winning ticket the day of the drawing. Long lines of ticket buyers characterized the scene at many of the state's retailers who sell Lotto tickets. "On drawing day, sales skyrocketed to $32.1 million, our highest one-day posting ever," Cloud said. "In fact, we registered the second-highest sales days for the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday before the March 7th drawing." The $85 million jackpot beat the previous record jackpot of $75 million. That happened in November of 1994 and the winning ticket was sold by Stop N Go #563, the Duncanville retailer who became the first member of the Retailer Half Million Club. "I want to congratulate Shoppers Mart for selling the big winner, and thank the nearly 17,000 other retailers who sold tickets for the biggest jackpot ever," said Cloud. "Their efforts to promote the Games of Texas positions the Texas Lottery as one of the top 10 lotteries in the world." There have been 11 Lotto Texas jackpot-winning tickets sold in the city of Austin. The last one, $28 million, was sold at Nau's Enfield Drugstore in March of 2000 and claimed by the HHH Fifty-Six Investments, Ltd., Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson, general partner. Tonight's Lotto jackpot is an estimated $22 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
