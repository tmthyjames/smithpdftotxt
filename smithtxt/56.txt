THREE DAYS UNTIL TEXAS TWO STEP - TWO EASY STEPS TO PLAY, ONE WAY TO WIN BIG
(Austin, May 10) - There may be three more days until the Texas Lottery Commission introduces its newest on-line game, Texas Two Step, but what players really need to know is - it takes only two easy steps to play, and one way to win big. "Texas Two Step is set to start," said Linda Cloud, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery. "It's only a few days until our lottery retailers and players will be 'two-steppin' their way to BIG money." Sales for the game, $1 per play, begin Sunday, May 13th and the first live drawing will be held on Friday, May 18th. Texas Two Step, the fifth on-line game introduced since the lottery's inception, will be drawn two nights a week, Tuesdays and Fridays, at 9:59 p.m. Players need to take just TWO easy steps to play: STEP 1: Pick four numbers from 1 to 35 in one play field STEP 2: Choose one Bonus Ball number from 1 to 35 in the second play field And what's the ONE way to win the top-prize? If a ticket matches all four numbers and the Bonus Ball, players will win the topprize amount, which starts at $200,000. "Although the top-prize amounts are not in the multi-millions, our Texas Two Step will provide players an exciting new way to play, and win, with good odds," said Cloud. Texas Two Step will offer players seven different ways to win and fantastic overall odds - 1:32 - of winning any prize. Players can win $5 for matching only the Bonus Ball number. The lottery's newest game will replace Texas Million on Friday evenings, with the last drawing for Texas Million held on Friday, May 11th. Players still have up to 180 days after the date of the drawing to claim a Texas Million prize. Players may claim any low tier on-line game prize up to and including $599 at any lottery retailer. Prizes of $600 to $300,000 may be redeemed at any of the 22 lottery claim centers, and prizes over $300,000 must be claimed at Lottery Headquarters in Austin. ....
