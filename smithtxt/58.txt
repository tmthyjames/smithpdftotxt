LOTTERY'S NEWEST GAME - TEXAS TWO STEP - SET TO DEBUT ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHTS
(Austin, May 7) - Beginning Friday, May 18, 2001, Texas Lottery players can start catching that two-steppin' bug with the first drawing for the lottery's new on-line game, Texas Two Step. Texas' newest game will be the first on-line game introduced in three years and the fifth on-line game started since the lottery began in 1992. "Players mark your calendars for Tuesday and Friday nights," recommended Texas Lottery Executive Director, Linda Cloud. Texas Two Step is different than any of our other on-line games, and will provide players great odds to win BIG money." Texas Two Step includes the same Bonus Ball feature similar to other multi-state on-line games offered by neighboring state lotteries in New Mexico and Louisiana. A select number of balls are drawn from one machine, and then a bonus ball is selected from another machine. The new on-line game will offer players seven different ways to win and fantastic overall odds - 1:32 - of winning any prize. And, it only takes two easy steps to play! First, players will pick four numbers from 1 to 35 in one play field, and then choose one Bonus Ball number from 1 to 35 in a second play field. If a ticket matches all four numbers and the Bonus Ball, players will win the top-prize amount, which starts at $200,000. Prizes will be divided equally among multiple top-prize winners. If no ticket matches all the numbers, the jackpot rolls over to the next drawing. Players can win $5 for matching only the Bonus Ball. The following table illustrates the prize categories and overall odds of winning Texas Two Step: WAYS TO WIN Match 4 + Bonus Ball Match 4 numbers Match 3 + Bonus Ball Match 3 numbers Match 2 + Bonus Ball Match 1 + Bonus Ball Match Bonus Ball ODDS OF WINNING 1:1,832,600 ESTIMATED PRIZE Jackpot*
