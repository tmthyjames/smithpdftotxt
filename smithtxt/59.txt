CUSTOMER SERVICE KEY TO CREATING GREAT SALES RECORDS AMONG LOTTERY RETAILERS
(Austin, April 20) - Texas Lottery retailers are agreed on one thing; it's the customer service that keeps Lottery players coming back. The Texas Lottery Commission, third-largest in sales in the United States and still ranked among the top 10 global lotteries, retains its strong sales due not only to players, but also to its retailers. "In the year 2000, our sales jumped by nearly 14 percent, thanks in large part to our retailers," said Lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud "Our top-selling retailers tell us they've got the secret to making the big sales and it can be summed up in the words `customer service.' The extra efforts of our ticket sellers can certainly make playing the `Games of Texas' more fun and create the high sales. The real story is in the numbers." The Lottery has 16,879 active retail outlets that sell its products. Of those, 16,249 sell online and instant tickets. The remaining 630 sell only instants. Retailers agree that good old-fashion customer service is the real ticket to success. "Our main goal is total customer service," said Kenneth Alexander, owner of Snappy Stop, Inc., in Burkburnett. "I make all our employees ask everyone that walks in if they would like to buy a lottery ticket, and we cash all winning tickets that are either purchased here or at other stores." Alexander's store took the number one spot in the Abilene District. Rudy's Stop and Shop in Rosenberg is at the top in the Houston District. Owner Rudy Blascke says honesty and integrity keep customers coming in the door. "It's about building trust with our customers and taking the time to teach them how to play the games," he said. "We explain pay outs and game information on Pick 3 and give store bonuses on Lotto Texas. If a customer gets four numbers, we give them a $10 bonus and if they get five numbers, we give them $150." In the McAllen district, Town and Country No. 1 rates won top billing in sales by offering players an added incentive to purchase Lotto tickets, in particular. "We offer players the chance to win a free pick-up truck if they purchase a Lotto Texas ticket here and win a jackpot over $14 million," said Albert Suárez, store manager. "Players get really excited because they can see the truck parked in front of the store." Lucky's Food Mart, Inc., in San Antonio has ranked among the major sellers of instant tickets for several years. Louis Hudspeth Jr., vice president of the corporation, says their motto is `the customer always comes first.' "We treat each and every customer as a potential Lottery winner," he said. "We're also fortunate that we've received outstanding assistance from our Lottery Sales Representative, whose suggestions have helped us increase our sales and provide better service. The Lottery meets face-to-face with retailers at monthly town hall meetings across Texas that have been held since 1998. "These meetings give us face time with our retailers, " Cloud said. "We learn what works for them and what they need from us so they can do a better job. It's their input that keeps us one of the best lotteries in the world.
