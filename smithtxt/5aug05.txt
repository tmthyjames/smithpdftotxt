Last $2 Million Prize Claimed For Texas Lottery® Holiday Million Wishes Scratch Game
(Austin, August 19) - The final top cash prize for the Texas Lottery® HOLIDAY MILLION WISHES scratch game was claimed today by Bok Bass of Corpus Christi. Bass was one of four top-prize winners for the popular lottery ticket issued in October of 2004. "Holiday Million Wishes was the first $30 ticket issued by the Texas Lottery and it was enormously popular with our players," said Texas Lottery Commission products manager, Robert Tirloni. "Not to worry, though, we'll have new holiday tickets for players to purchase beginning in late October." Bass purchased her ticket at Times Market #47, located at 610 Weber Road in Corpus Christi. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. HOLIDAY MILLION WISHES still has cash prizes of $20,000, $2,000, $500, $300, $100, $70, $40 and $30. Overall odds of winning any prize in the game are 1 in 2.17, including break-even prizes. The winner has requested minimum publicity. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org
