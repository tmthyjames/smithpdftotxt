"I Want Everyone To Know I Won," Says Bedford Texas Lottery® Winner

Mary Scheppler of Bedford will soon hold the key to her new 2004 Corvette Convertible she won in the Texas Lottery Corvette Cash second-chance drawing.

(Austin, February 18) - Mary Scheppler says she plans on driving her new car, a 2004 Chevrolet Corvette® Convertible, a lot. "That is," she continued, "between the times that my husband won't be driving it." Scheppler won the single Chevrolet Corvette available in the fifth and final Texas Lottery® Corvette® Cash second-chance drawing. "I got a call on Valentine's Day from a Lottery staff member, and she told me I had won the Corvette," Scheppler explained. "I couldn't believe it. I walked around the rest of day really excited. My husband has told everyone." "What a great Valentine's surprise," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Mrs. Scheppler was one of many participants that sent in their nonwinning tickets for a second chance at a prize for the Texas Lottery Corvette Cash scratch game. The second-chance drawings allow us to give players other opportunities for a shot

at winning if they didn't win the first go-around on a ticket." There were four instant win Corvettes given away for the scratch game, and three top cash prizes of $25,000. Scheppler told lottery officials she grew up in Boerne. The coincidence she explained is, "that's where the first Corvette was given away." Velma Houy of Boerne collected her Corvette convertible in August 2004. "I'm going to choose a red Corvette, since I found out about it on Valentine's," Scheppler said. "I've never owned a red car before, and I've always wanted a Corvette. I can't wait to drive my mom around in it."
