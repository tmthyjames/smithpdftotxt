It's A Pflugerville Phenomenom
(Austin, June 17) - There's something Pfunny going on in Pflugerville today. The Texas Lottery® has presented two different winners, both from the area, with cash prizes equaling a million dollars or more, before taxes. Michael Huckabay presented his $1,000,000 CLUB scratch game to lottery officials this afternoon, just hours after Da Huu Pham claimed his instant ticket prize of $10,000 a month for 20 years - in the Texas Lottery Monthly Bonus (game #534) scratch-off game (prize totaling $2,400,000). "I had begun to stop buying this one, but when I went in the store to get a couple of sodas, all I had with me is a $100 bill," explained Huckabay. "I was going to have to wait for change, so I told him to give me the last $1,000,000 Club game he had in the dispenser. I even dropped it on my way out to the truck." Huckabay scratched the ticket while in the parking lot. When he realized he might have won the $1 million top prize, he said he immediately called his wife. "I couldn't dial the number, I couldn't breathe right. It's overwhelming," he said. "What a pfine way to end the week," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Besides adding some cash to our players wallets this month, we've added an additional $95,000,000 to the state's coffers, bringing the Fiscal Year 2005 total to equal more than $748,000,000 transferred to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in Texas." Huckabay purchased his ticket at Wag A Bag, located at 2500 FM 1431 in Round Rock. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. As of today, there is still one top cash prize of $1 million to claim in the $1,000,000 CLUB scratch game. Other cash prizes in the game range from $25 to $20,000. The overall odds of winning, including break-even prizes are 1 in 2.79.
