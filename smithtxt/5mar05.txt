Homework Helps Del Rio Hot 50's Player Harvest $25,000 Haul

(Austin, March 24) - When it comes to Texas Lottery® scratch-off games, Del Rio's Belinda Rodriguez knows it only takes one ticket to win. She also knows it pays to do your homework, and did it ever, when the Hot 50's ticket she purchased earlier this week won the game's top prize ­ $25,000! "I usually check the Texas Lottery's Web site before I buy a ticket to see which games have the most top prizes remaining," said Rodriguez. "When I saw how many were left for Hot 50's, I thought I'd give it a shot and I just bought one." As many players like Rodriguez know, the Texas Lottery updates its list of remaining

scratch-off ticket top prizes on its Web site on a weekly basis. "I like to know as much as I can before I buy my tickets and it definitely paid off this time," said Rodriguez. "It also helps to be positive; it can happen to you too!" Rodriguez said she is a regular Texas Lottery scratch-off player and had won as much as $500 before her big Hot 50's win. She plans to use some of her winnings to pay off bills and will invest the rest. "In addition to the $25,000, Ms. Rodriguez gets a big A+ for doing her homework," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The number of remaining winning tickets is just the beginning of what players can learn about the Games of Texas from our Web site, and I encourage everyone to take advantage of this valuable resource." Rodriguez purchased her ticket at the EZ Stop Convenience Store located at 200 Western Dr. in Del Rio. In addition to the top prizes of $25,000, the $2 Hot 50's game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $2 to $1,000.
