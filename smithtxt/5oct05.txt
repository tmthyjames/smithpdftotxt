With The Finish Line Approaching, Two Top Prizes Remain Unclaimed In Mustang Money Scratch Game
(Austin, October 13) - The Texas Lottery® MUSTANG MONEY scratch-off game offered four top prizes ­ brand-new Ford Mustang Convertibles ­ and 12 $20,000 top-cash prizes when it debuted on May 12. Now, with more than 90 percent of the tickets for this game sold, two convertibles and one $20,000 prize remain unclaimed. "With more than five million tickets sold since the game came out, our players have certainly gotten a lot of mileage out of MUSTANG MONEY," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "We don't know if the tickets in question have actually been sold yet or if they are still available at lottery retail locations, but we'd definitely love to see the remaining top prizes claimed before this game crosses the finish line." Sales of Texas Lottery scratch-off games typically end after about 90 percent of the inventory is sold, but prizes may be claimed up to 180 days after the game closes. Mustang convertible prizes must be claimed at a Texas Lottery Claim Center. In addition to the remaining cars and $20,000 cash prize, the $3 MUSTANG MONEY also offers prizes ranging from $3 to $2,000.
