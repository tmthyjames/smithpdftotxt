Texas Lottery® Returns More Than $1 Billion To The State For Second Consecutive Year
(Austin, September 16) - The Texas Lottery® announced today the amount transferred to the Foundation School Fund for Fiscal Year 2005, ending August 31, totaled $1.016 billion. It is a 1.3 percent increase over the last fiscal year, which totaled more than $1.003 billion. It also marks the second consecutive year the lottery has transferred more than $1 billion back to the state for public education. "Not since the early-to-mid starting years of the Texas Lottery have we seen a continued increase in sales and transfers to the state," said Gary Grief, acting executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Thanks to our players and retailers, fiscal year 2005 makes the fourth consecutive year we have increased our support of public education in Texas." Sales for all Texas Lottery products, totaling $3,662,462,838, were up 5 percent over FY 04, which totaled $3,487,924,569. Players won prizes in excess of $2.2 billion, and more than 16,000 lottery retailers earned more than $186 million in commissions and bonuses. Instant tickets accounted for $2.7 billion, or 73.9 percent, of total sales, with $1.8 billion paid out to players in prize monies. Lotto Texas®, the flag-ship Texas Lottery on-line game, registered $306.7 million in sales. That amount is down 35.8 percent from FY 04, when total sales were $477.8 million. There were five jackpot-winning tickets sold, and players claimed more than $150.1 million in cash prizes, including jackpot winnings. "Looking ahead, we are considering changes to the Lottery's mix of games, including Lotto Texas," Grief said. "We are evaluating measures to help stem the current trend of declining sales in some Texas Lottery games that could hinder our total return to the state at the end of this fiscal year." The multistate Mega MillionsTM game accounted for $177.4 million for FY 05 sales, a 6.5 percent decrease over FY 04. Texas' own Megaplier feature, which allows players the chance to double, triple or quadruple a non-grand/jackpot prize, accounted for more than

$40 million in FY 05 sales, an 11.6 percent decrease from last year. The Pick 3® game showed yet another rise in player participation over previous years, with nearly $285 million in total sales, an increase of 2.8 percent from last year. Cash Five® accounted for $102.6 million in sales, a 16.1 percent decrease, and Texas Two Step® sales totaled more than $45 million, an 8.3 percent decrease. "While the agency is proud of these results, we recognize that this rate of growth is likely to be unsustainable and that future results may be flat or possibly decrease, in large part due to the maturity of the Texas Lottery and to increased competition from other gambling activities, legal and illegal, in Texas and surrounding states," said Grief.
