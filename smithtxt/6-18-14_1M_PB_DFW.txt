PONDER RESIDENT WINS $1 MILLION POWERBALL® SECOND-TIER PRIZE

(AUSTIN) ­ Scott McDaniel of Ponder heard about a $1 million Powerball® winner while cashing in some scratch-off tickets at Bev's, 1003 N. FM 156 in Ponder, but he had no idea it was one of his tickets.

"I had some tickets in my truck and also in our house at home, so I went home and checked them," McDaniel explained. "The tickets in the truck did not win, but the ones I left on my table saw had the winning ticket."

The Quick Pick ticket from Bev's matched all five numbers (15 ­ 27 ­ 31 ­ 34 ­ 48) but not the Powerball (1) for the drawing held May 31. In fact, more than 32,000 tickets in Texas won prizes ranging from $4 to $1 million for that drawing.

Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and roll until the jackpot is won. Players win the jackpot by matching the five white ball numbers (1-59) and the red Powerball number (1-35). The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately one in 31. The odds of winning the jackpot prize are one in 175,223,510.

McDaniel believes there was divine intervention in his win, "I don't believe in luck. This is just one of many of God's blessings in my life."
