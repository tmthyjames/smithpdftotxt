MONDAY IS LAST DAY TO CLAIM $12 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS® JACKPOT PRIZE

(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission is asking Lotto Texas® players that purchased tickets for the Jan. 1 drawing to check their tickets. Though a ticket matching all six numbers drawn was purchased from the South Shore Shell located at 3390 FM 518 in League City, the drawing's $12 million jackpot has not been claimed. The deadline to claim the New Year's Day prize is Monday, June 30. The winning numbers for the drawing were 15-17-43-45-47-50. The cash value of the $12 million jackpot is $7,562,273.98. "We encourage our players to take another look at their ticket, check the numbers again and if your numbers match, sign the back of the ticket and contact us," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery. For selling the winning ticket, South Shore Shell was presented a retailer bonus check for $121,385.34 on March 6. A ticket holder forfeits any claim to a prize for a draw game after the expiration of the 180th day following the draw date. The deadline may be extended for a period of time for certain "eligible" military personnel. Unclaimed prizes revert back to the state for programs authorized by the Texas Legislature. Since 1995, more than $837 million in unclaimed Texas Lottery prize funds has gone back to the state. Lotto Texas has been a favorite game for players from the first drawing held Nov. 14, 1992, just six months after the official Texas Lottery launch. It is Texas' original jackpot game and continues to contribute to the Lottery's overall sales, which reached record levels last year.
