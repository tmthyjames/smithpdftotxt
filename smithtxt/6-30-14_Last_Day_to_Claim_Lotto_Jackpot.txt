The deadline may be extended for a period of time for certain "eligible" military personnel. Unclaimed prizes revert back to the state for programs authorized by the Texas Legislature. Since 1995, more than $837 million in unclaimed Texas Lottery prize funds has gone back to the state. Lotto Texas has been a favorite game for players from the first drawing held Nov. 14, 1992, just six months after the official Texas Lottery launch. It is Texas' original jackpot game and continues to contribute to the Lottery's overall sales, which reached record levels last year.
