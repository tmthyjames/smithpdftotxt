RECORD $85 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS SALES FACT SHEET
(Austin, March 9) - This week Lotto fever swept the entire state from border to border and everywhere in between. The game's record $85 million jackpot broke the game's previous Wednesday sales record and created long lines inside and outside many of Texas' 16,244 retail outlets that sell Lotto Texas tickets. Due to record sales, the jackpot prize exceeded the estimated $85 million jackpot by $2,427,961.00. The winner chose the Cash Value Option, which provides a final prize of $51,214,323.00, before the 28 percent federal tax is withheld, and gives a net value sum of $36,809,513.00 to the lucky `lone' ticket holder. Lotto began "rolling" to its $85 million record on January 31st, starting at $4 million. Lotto Sales hit their peak between 6:00-7:00 PM Wednesday when tickets were selling at more than 64,000 per minute, or in excess of 1,000 tickets per second. Wednesday's one-day Lotto sales soared to $32,134,154.00, the highest ever. The game also registered the second-highest sales for the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday prior to the March 7 drawing. The largest single-winner Lotto prize was awarded to Joe Jones of Mansfield. He won $55 million in November of 1994. This was before the Cash Value Option was available to players. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
