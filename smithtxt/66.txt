LOTTO TEXAS SALES SKYROCKET; JACKPOT BUMPED TO $85 MILLION
(Austin, March 7) - Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud this morning bumped tonight's record $77 million Lotto Texas jackpot to a new high, $85 million. "Our sales shot out of the bin this morning, and coupled with near-record sales for the past three days, it was clear that we could offer our players an even bigger prize for tonight," Cloud said. "In fact, we racked up the second largest sales Tuesday ever yesterday, with the one-day total reaching $11,400,113. At the peak of sales yesterday during after-work drive time, players were buying 20,286 tickets per minute. "Between 6 and 7 a.m. today, we logged sales of nearly $483,000," Cloud said. "Yesterday's sales at the same hour were $170,000. That little snapshot indicates `Lotto Fever' is sweeping the Lone Star State. Our players said they would return to the game if we offered larger jackpots-and they are-in record numbers. " But we caution our players to be prudent when they buy tickets, to play responsibly. We want to remind everyone it only takes one dollar to play, and only one ticket to win." Cloud said tonights Lotto Texas jackpot is not only a record in Texas but also the highest jackpot currently offered in the nation. If there is no winner tonight, the Lotto Texas jackpot will roll to at least $100 million for Saturday's drawing. "It'll be that and probably more," Cloud added. "We'll know later today." .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
