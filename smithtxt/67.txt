(Austin, March 7) - The jackpot for Wednesday, March 07, 2001 has been "bumped" to $85 million and is the largest lottery jackpot in the United States (presently even larger than the multi-state lotteries like Powerball and The Big Game).
q

Since Sunday, daily sales record have run a close second with previous record daily sales for the 1994 estimated $75 million jackpot with one exception: Wednesday's sales are also starting out higher. The retailer(s) that sells a winning 6 of 6 ticket tonight also wins. The retailer(s) are eligible for a bonus of up to 1% of the jackpot amount, or a maximum bonus of $500,000.

If the winner chooses the Cash Option, the winner will receive a lump sum of roughly half the jackpot amount or about $ 44,756,206 before taxes (the amount the Lottery would invest in U.S. Treasury Bonds to pay the prize over 25 years).

q

With at least 31% of all Lottery sales going to The Foundation School Fund, the sales from the drawings leading to the estimated $85 million jackpot (and its 10 rolls) will generate an estimated $40 million to support public education in Texas.
