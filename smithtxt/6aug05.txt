Edinburg Texas Lottery® Winner: Cool, Calm And Collecting $75,000 Prize

Flor Salinas of Edinburg collected one of eight $75,000 top prizes for the Bonus Break the Bank scratch games

(Austin, August 18) - By the sound of her voice, you might not pick up on the fact that Flor Salinas of Edinburg claimed a $75,000 cash prize from the Texas Lottery Harlingen Claim Center. Salinas scratched her way to collecting the top prize for the Texas Lottery® BONUS BREAK THE BANK. "I just scratched the ticket in my car after I bought it," Salinas said. "I went back into the store to make sure my eyes weren't lying to me. Then, I drove home, put the ticket away

and waited to come in and get the prize." Salinas explained she hasn't even told anyone about her big win. "I'll call my family when I get home," she said. The top-prize winning ticket was purchased at Spanky's Beer Barn, located at Highway 107 in Mission. As of today, the BONUS BREAK THE BANK (#599) has seven top prizes left to win. The overall odds of winning, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 3.23. "It's not very often we get players as cool and calm as Flor when claiming a big cash prize. Most of the time, our winners say they jumped up and down, cried, yelled and called everyone they know to tell the good news," said Texas Lottery Commission products manager, Robert Tirloni. "At the end of the day, though, it doesn't matter how a player's emotions are overrun; all that matters is we have another happy winner with a check in their hands." Salinas says she wants to pay off her bills and invest the rest of her winnings. "I don't play that often, but something just told me to buy this ticket," she explained. "I'll have to show everyone the check, because no one will believe me."
