Lubbock Winner Scratches His Way To $10,000 Run The Table Prize

Weldon Pickens of Lubbock won $10,000 in the Run The Table scratch-off game.

(Austin, February 9) - Weldon Pickens of Lubbock purchased a Texas Lottery® Run The Table scratch-off ticket last week and took it home to see if he won. It took a little work and a lot of scratching, but it was all worth it when Pickens finally realized his ticket was worth $10,000. "I took it home and started scratching," said Pickens. "At first it looked like I won $100 and then $1000. The faster I scratched, the more money I won, until I realized I had just won a whopping $10,000!" Pickens said he plans to put his winnings in the bank for now and will continue to keep playing the Games of Texas.

"I've been playing the lottery since day one and I'm not going to quit now," said Pickens. "Persistence pays off!" "Persistence really did pay off for Mr. Pickens and I think he'd agree that $10,000 is a pretty good reward for all the scratching he did," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "At $25, Run The Table is one of our higher price-point games, but we've got dozens more scratch-off tickets to fit anyone's entertainment budget, with prices from $1 to $30." In addition to the top prize of $1,000,000, Run The Table offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $25 to $20,000. Pickens purchased his ticket at the Kwik Stop #3 located at 4719 58th St. in Lubbock.
