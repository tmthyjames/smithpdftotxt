Tuition Not A Worry For Nursing Student, Thanks To $21,021 Cash Five® Top Prize

Cash Five winner Krystina Smith, who yesterday afternoon collected a prize of $21,021.

(Austin, January 19) - Today is the first day of classes for Wharton Junior College nursing student, Krystina Smith, who yesterday afternoon collected a Texas Lottery® Cash Five® prize of $21,021, winnings that will pay for tuition and then some. "First, I'm going to buy my momma something nice for keeping the ticket in a safe place," Smith said. "Second, I'm going to get something nice for my sister, my two brothers and my step-dad. The rest I'll save for college and maybe for getting a new car. And I'm taking my family out to eat, too, and it's my treat." Smith's mother, Linda, kept the ticket in her Bible. The drawing occurred on Friday, January 14. The numbers drawn were 4-2-30-16-32. "Family first, closely followed by education, that's an A-plus for our latest Cash Five winner and her prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E.

Greer. "Ms. Smith's prize was one of two for the Cash Five drawing held last Friday. Another ticket in Hughes Springs also matched the numbers drawn that night for a prize in the same amount." Smith was watching the news on Channel 11 (KHOU-TV), when she saw the numbers on her ticket come up. "I started jumping up and down," Smith said. "I was shocked, just in disbelief. My mom and I read out the numbers 10 times, at least, just because we didn't believe it." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $51 million. Tomorrow's Texas Two Step® drawing is worth $200,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.txlottery.org ...
