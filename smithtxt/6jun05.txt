Fortunate Pflugerville Resident Looking Forward To Monthly Bonus For Next 20 Years
(Austin, June 17) - Da Huu Pham of Pflugerville today claimed the top prize ­ $10,000 a month for 20 years ­ in the Texas Lottery® Monthly Bonus (game #534) scratch-off game. The total amount of the prize before taxes is $2,400,000. "$10,000 a month for the next 20 years is a Monthly Bonus anyone would be happy to collect," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Mr. Pham claimed the second of two top prizes for game #534 today, but Monthly Bonus #597 came out just a couple of weeks ago, so two more top prizes are still out there." The winning ticket was purchased at the Albertson's #4064, located at 1601 West Pecan Street in Pflugerville. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning ticket. The winner requested minimal publicity. In addition to the top prizes, the $5 Monthly Bonus game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $20,000.
