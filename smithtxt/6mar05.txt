House-Hunting Plans In The Future For Texas Lottery® Winner And Her Husband

Sarah Mayberry of Oak Cliff and her ceremonial check for $110,000, the top cash prize on the Texas Lottery Wild 10's scratch-off game.

(Austin, March 22) - Sarah Mayberry of Oak Cliff had all weekend to think of something she wanted to buy, and after collecting her $110,000 Wild 10's scratch game prize, said she and her husband are going to start looking for a new house. "We're going to stay in the Oak Cliff area," Mayberry told lottery officials. "I'm just so excited."

Mayberry is the fourth winner of the top-cash prize for the Texas Lottery® Wild 10's scratch-off game. She purchased her ticket on Saturday at the 7-Eleven store located at 5501 S. Buckner in Dallas. "I've always bought Break the Bank tickets, but decided to try my luck at a $10 game," she explained. "I got so excited when scratching the ticket in my car; I went back inside the store and asked a police officer if what I was seeing was right. He said, 'Yes, ma'am, it looks like it.' I was so nervous; I called my husband to come get me. I couldn't drive back home." "I expect Ms. Mayberry and her husband will find just the right house they want using their Wild 10's prize money," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And even with Spring Break going on last week, the Texas Lottery didn't take a break handing out nearly $40 million in cash prizes to other lucky winners across the state."
