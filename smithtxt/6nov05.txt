Texas Megapliers Rake In Mega Bucks In Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing, Friday's Estimated Jackpot $262 Million
(Austin, November 10) - The jackpot for Friday night's Mega MillionsTM drawing will be an estimated $262 million, the second largest in the history of the Texas Lottery®. Though no tickets matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in Tuesday's drawing, three tickets sold in Texas did match five numbers. The purchasers of two of those tickets also chose to MegaplyTM. Since Tuesday's Megaplier number was 3, the value of those two tickets was increased from $250,000 to $750,000. Statewide, Megaplied tickets sold for Tuesday's drawing are worth more than $1.86 million. "More than 22,000 Texas Mega Millions players tripled their winnings by Megaplying their tickets for Tuesday night," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery. "Friday's near-record estimated jackpot might be hard to resist, but we still want to remind all of our players to play responsibly." The multistate Mega Millions game, which Texas joined in December 2003, holds the record for the largest jackpot in North American history. On May 9, 2000, the jackpot for The Big Game (now known as Mega Millions) reached $363 million. The largest prize Texas Lottery players have vied for was a $290 million Mega Millions jackpot in June 2004. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times. For example, if a player Megaplies and the Megaplier number is 4, a second-tier (5 of 5 numbers) prize increases from $250,000 to $1 million. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are approximately 1 in 176 million. The overall odds of winning any prize are approximately 1 in 40.
