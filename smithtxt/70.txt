BRAGGING RIGHTS - $77 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS JACKPOT IS THE HIGHEST IN THE UNITED STATES
(Austin, March 5) - As of yesterday, the Texas Lottery Commission has something to brag about. The current Lotto Texas jackpot, $77 million, is the highest jackpot within the United States and the highest jackpot in Texas Lottery's history. Lotto Fever has returned and the Texas Lottery is urging retailers and players to be ready. "We know our players typically like to wait until the day of the drawing to buy their tickets, about 65 to 70 percent of sales are done on Wednesdays and Saturdays," said Linda Cloud, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "I can't urge our players enough to buy their tickets early to avoid long lines at their favorite lottery retailer. "With sales yesterday already exceeding $1.2 million, we're expecting retailers will experience the kind of excitement the lottery had in 1994 with the $75 million Lotto jackpot," Cloud added. Ticket sales for the Wednesday, March 16, 1994, drawing at one time reached over $3.5 million in one hour, or more than 66,000 tickets per minute during peak sales periods. Saturday's sales for the $56 million Lotto Texas drawing reached over $1.6 million in one hour or more than 25,000 tickets per minute. "As always," Cloud added, "we urge our players to play responsibly. They should keep in mind, regardless of the jackpot amount, it only takes $1.00 to play, and one ticket to win." The Lottery drawing for Wednesday's Lotto Texas will take place at 9:59 p.m. at the lottery's drawing studio in Austin. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
