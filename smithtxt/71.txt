TEXAS LOTTERY HITS THE BIG ONE - $77 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS JACKPOT - THE HIGHEST IN TEXAS LOTTERY HISTORY!
(Austin, March 3) - Tonight, the Texas Lottery Commission hit an all time record. The Lotto Texas jackpot rolled to a staggering $77 million, the highest in the lottery's history. "This is what makes Lotto Texas so exciting," said Linda Cloud, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "It's a thrill to finally break a seven year record!" The highest Lotto Texas jackpot to date was $75 million, for the drawing held March 16, 1994. There were five winning tickets sold for that drawing, and each ticket paid its winners more than $15 million. For that drawing, during the peak sales period, Lotto Texas tickets were being purchased statewide at a rate of more than 66,000 each minute. The highest jackpot for last year, was the $60 million Lotto Texas prize on September 9, 2000. "We anticipate our retailers will have a very busy week, and may want to bring on additional help for the expected long ticket lines," Cloud said. "We're going into uncharted territory with this jackpot, and it's going to be quite a ride. With $77 million up for grabs, the 'Eyes of Texas' will definitely be on Lotto Texas fever." Lotto Texas drawings are held every Wednesday and Saturday night at 9:59 p.m. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
