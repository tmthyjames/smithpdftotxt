$45 MILLION LOTTO TEXAS JACKPOT KEEPS SALES BRISK THROUGHOUT THE DAY
(Austin, February 28) - Tonight's $45 million Lotto Texas jackpot has grabbed players' interest and kept sales climbing all day. This is the highest Lotto jackpot since we climbed to $48 million last November," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud. "Our sales got a fast start this morning and have been increasing all day." During the lunchtime rush, players were buying 7,887 tickets per minute. The count between 2 and 3 p.m. showed tickets were selling at 9,700 tickets per minute. In the first 30 minutes of the 3 o'clock hour, tickets were going at approximately 12,500 per minute. "I don't get tired of telling people that Lotto is a jackpot-driven game," Cloud said. "The higher the jackpot goes, so our sales also go." The next rush of sales is expected during drive time between 5 and 7 p.m. "We can expect sales to top the lunchtime rush," Cloud said. "We will probably get close to selling one million tickets per hour." Cloud said tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is the second highest in the nation behind California, which has a $60 million prize for its six-of-six game. If there is no winner tonight, the Lotto Texas jackpot will roll to $56 million for Saturday's drawing. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
