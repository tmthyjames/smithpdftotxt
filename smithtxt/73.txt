TEXAS LOTTERY COMMISSION APPROVES NEW ON-LINE GAME - TEXAS TWO STEP
(Austin, February 15) - Today, the Texas Lottery Commissioners unanimously voted to approve the introduction of the lottery's newest on-line game - Texas Two Step. This will be first on-line game launched in nearly three years and the fifth on-line game introduced since the lottery began in 1992. "We're very excited about offering our players this new game - Texas Two Step," said Linda Cloud, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's different, it means more prizes to our players, it's easy to play, and it's easy to win!" Texas Two Step includes the same Bonus Ball feature as multi-state on-line games. A select number of balls are drawn from one machine, and then a bonus ball is selected from another machine. "After hearing from our lottery retailers and players in focus groups last fall, we have decided to implement an on-line game many said they would like to play," said Cloud. "Although the top-prize amounts are not in the multi-millions, our Texas Two Step will provide players an exciting new way to win big money with better odds." Texas Two Step will offer players seven different ways to win and fantastic overall odds - 1:32 - of winning any prize. Players will pick four numbers from 1 to 35 in one play field, and then choose one Bonus Ball number from 1 to 35 in a second play field. If a ticket matches all four numbers and the Bonus Ball, players will win the top-prize amount, which starts at $200,000. Prizes will be divided equally among multiple top-prize winners. If no ticket matches all the numbers, the jackpot rolls over to the next drawing. Players can win $5 for matching as little as one ball. The following table illustrates the prize categories and overall odds of winning Texas Two Step: WAYS TO WIN Match 4 + Bonus Ball Match 4 numbers Match 3 + Bonus Ball Match 3 numbers Match 2 + Bonus Ball Match 1 + Bonus Ball ODDS OF WINNING 1:1,832,600 ESTIMATED PRIZE Jackpot*
