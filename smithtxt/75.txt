CASH 5: STILL COMING UP ROSES AFTER 1,000 DRAWINGS
(Austin, February 14) - Cash 5, the Texas Lottery's five-of-five online game, reaches its 1000th drawing tomorrow. "When we premiered Cash 5 in October of 1995, we promoted the game by saying, `It's what's shaking,'" said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud. "And, it's still shaking. In fact, it's been a bed of roses. It's produced more than 2,000 top-prize-winners and retailer bonuses in excess of $1 million dollars. " The game went on sale on October 10, 1995. The first drawing was on Friday October 13th, and was promoted from the State Fair of Texas in Dallas via satellite. "When the game began, drawings were held twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays," Cloud said. "The game's popularity prompted us to add Monday and Thursday to the lineup in November of 1996, and I believe our players have certainly enjoyed it." Cloud cited the following statistics:

148 retailers have sold two winning tickets 13 retailers have sold three winning tickets Two retailers have sold four winning tickets Sunglo #27 on W. W. White Road, San Antonio, has sold six top-prize tickets 2,178 top-prize-winning tickets have been sold through January 29, 2001 Retailer bonuses for this game have reached $1,116,903.51 through 1-29-01

Since the game began, players have received more than $652 million in prizes. Cash 5 is a roll-down game, says Cloud, which is one of the entertaining aspects of the game that keeps players coming back. "If there is no five-of-five winner, the top-prize money rolls down to the players who matched four-of-five numbers," Cloud said. "So a prize that would average around $400 or $500 jumps to more than $1,000." Sales of Cash 5 have exceeded $1 billion, which Cloud calls "a testament to the game's continuing popularity." .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
