LOTTERY DEMOGRAPHIC STUDY REVEALS WHO PLAYS 'THE GAMES OF TEXAS'
(Austin, January 29) - Every two years, the Texas Lottery Commission has the Office of Survey Research at the University of Texas' College of Communication in Austin conduct a survey of its players. As in years past, the results again dispel popular misconceptions about who buys lottery tickets. "The 2001 study's results were consistent with the findings from the previous three surveys," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud. "Contrary to well-known myths, Texans who earn the lowest income and who have the least amount of education are significantly less likely to buy a ticket. This finding is significant because it addresses one of the biggest misconceptions surrounding the Lottery. The findings of this survey, as in all previous surveys conducted, show the opposite to be true about who really plays 'the Games of Texas.'" The survey also found that approximately 63 percent of all adult Texans have played at least one Texas Lottery game in the past year. "While the percentage of play is down five percent from the 1999 level, there's been a hike in the amount of reported monthly spending," Cloud said. "We believe the increase coincides with increases in sales recorded after the return of the prize payout and following changes to the matrix of the Lotto Texas game made last July." Other significant findings include:  Age: Those most likely to play fall in the age range of 26 to 65 years, and comprise 63 percent of Texans who play the Texas Lottery.  Education: College graduates and those with some college education (35 and 28 percent, respectively) were the most likely to play Lottery games. Only nine percent of Lottery players have less than a high school education.  Income Level: Texans most likely to play report earning $30,000 a year or more (70 percent), with a greater proportion of this group reporting an annual income of $50,000 or higher (44 percent). Players with incomes less $10,000 are the least likely group to play (6 percent). Ethnicity: The survey showed there is little difference among ethnic groups related to incidence each group plays Texas Lottery games, in proportion to the representation within the state. Caucasians (64 percent) represent the greatest number of players, followed by Hispanics (25 percent), African American (9 percent).
