'Just Keep Playing,' Advises Wichita Falls Mega MillionsTM Winner - Collects $700,000 Prize

Deborah Quintero says she always plays Mega Millions and always Megaplies - routine won her $700,000 from April 8 drawing.

(Austin, April 13) - Deborah Quintero advised Texas Lottery® players to 'just keep playing Mega Millions.' The 47-year-old Wichita Falls player voiced that opinion yesterday after collecting her $700,000 Mega MillionsTM prize. "I bought $4-worth of Mega Millions and always play the Megaplier," said Quintero. "When I remembered to look in the Times Record News on Tuesday morning, I saw I had five of the numbers from Friday night's drawing. At first I thought I had won only the $175,000 prize, but then it didn't take long to remember I played the Megaplier, too." Quintero, alone in her home at the time, said she jumped up and down and 'screamed

out.' "There were three tickets from Friday night's drawing that matched the first five numbers correctly, and two of those Megaplied the $175,000 prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "Since the Megaplier number was 4, the prize got ratcheted up to $700,000. The second ticket worth $700,000 was purchased in Allen." The remaining second-tier prize ticket was sold in La Vernia, near San Antonio. Quintero purchased her winning ticket at the 7-Eleven at 4404 Northwest Freeway in Wichita Falls. "I always stop there to buy my tickets," said Quintero. The Mega Millions numbers for the Friday, April 8, drawing, were: 05 - 13 - 17 - 33 - 35 and the Mega Ball was 35. Since no tickets matched all five numbers and the Mega Ball for Tuesday's Mega Millions drawing, the estimated jackpot for Friday is $144 million. Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $39 million.
