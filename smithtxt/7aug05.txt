(AUSTIN, August 17) - The non-profit organizations in Texas that conduct bingo games and the players who love yelling "BINGO" had a big second quarter this year, as gross receipts were tallied at $155.3 million and prizes awarded totaled $117.1 million. "The gross receipts and the prizes awarded are more than numbers; these figures reveal how popular bingo really is," said Texas Lottery Commission Charitable Bingo Director Billy Atkins. "Charitable Bingo isn't just the life-blood of many charities across the state, it's also a social life-line for veteran players who enjoy the camaraderie of playing and the friendships they've formed with like-minded individuals. The significant hike in gross receipts of $7.3 million and $7.2 million in prizes awarded from the same quarter last truly demonstrates how charitable bingo games are a workhorse for Texas charities." There are 1,293 non-profit organizations that conduct bingo games in Texas. Charitable Bingo was legalized in 1982. Since then, charities have tallied more than $11.9 billion in gross receipts. Players have won more than $8.7 billion in prizes. For more information about Charitable Bingo, visit http://www.txbingo.org.
