Cameron Scratch-Off Player Strikes $20,000 Worth Of Pure Gold

William F. Hulse of Cameron won $20,000 from the Pure Gold scratch-off game.

(Austin, January 13) - William F. Hulse of Cameron enjoys playing all of the Texas Lottery® scratch-off games and has won as much as $1,000 in the past. However, none of the other games panned out as well as the top prize he won this week in the $2 Pure Gold game ­ $20,000! Hulse said he plays the Games of Texas mostly just for fun, but he definitely thinks

they're even more fun when he wins. "I've always told myself I'd win one of the big prizes," said Hulse. "I guess it was just my time. I just hope it's not the last time." Hulse said he plans to use some of the money to pay some bills and will absolutely continue to play Texas Lottery games. In fact, Hulse said he won an additional $200 on another scratch-off game on the same day as his Pure Gold win. "Pure Gold certainly paid off in an exciting way for Mr. Hulse," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "What's even more exciting is the fact that all net revenue from Texas Lottery sales goes to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in our state." In addition to the top prizes of $20,000, Pure Gold offers cash prizes in the following amounts: $2,000, $200, $50, $20, $10, $5, $4 and $2. Hulse purchased his ticket at the Wag-A-Bag #9 located at 308 Hwy. 79 in Hutto.
