$875,000 Has Lancaster Texas Two Step® Player Dancing All The Way To The Bank

Debra Wade of Lancaster won the $875,000 jackpot for the July 11 Texas Two Step drawing.

(Austin, July 15) - Lancaster's Debra Wade has played the same numbers for every Texas Two Step® drawing since the Texas Lottery® game debuted in 2001, and her husband's been driving the same old pick-up truck for a lot longer than that. So they were both delighted that her dedication finally paid off in a big way ­ $875,000 before taxes ­ when those numbers matched all four numbers plus the Bonus Ball in the Monday night drawing. Wade, a school-library assistant and mother of three teen-age girls, could hardly believe her luck when she finally got around to checking her numbers on Wednesday morning.

And even then, she had to make numerous phone calls just to make sure. "I just couldn't believe it; I started shaking all over and all I could say was 'Oh, my gosh!' over and over," said Wade. "And then I started calling all over the place ­ my husband, my parents, my best friend ­ just to get some confirmation I wasn't seeing things!" Wade, whose largest previous Texas Lottery win was $630 in Pick 3®, knows exactly where some of her winnings are going. "First, I'm going to get this check in the bank, and second, I'm going to buy my husband a brand new truck," said Wade. "The one he has now has over 300,000 miles on it, so I think he's earned a new one." Wade also said she plans to take a quick road trip with her best friend before school starts back up next month. No word yet on whether her husband will let her borrow his new truck for that trip. "We're all very excited about Ms. Wade's Texas Two Step win, though maybe not quite as excited as her husband," said Bobby Heith, director of media relations for the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's always exciting when our players win, but we also always like to remind our players to remember that it's just a game, so please play responsibly!" Texas Two Step features drawings on Mondays and Thursdays, with jackpots starting at $200,000. The numbers drawn for Monday night's drawing were 5 ­ 10 ­ 16 ­ 27 and the Bonus Ball was 8. The winning ticket was purchased at the Exxon #60476, located at 447 East Highway 67 in Duncanville. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $8,750 for selling the winning ticket. Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimated $122 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $23 million.
