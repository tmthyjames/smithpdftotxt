Waco Woman Cashes In $19,716 Cash Five® Ticket

Mary Lewallen of Waco won $19,716 in the February 28 Cash Five drawing.

(Austin, March 21) - Mary Lewallen of Waco was on a Cash Five® lucky streak in the last week of February, with wins on several consecutive nights. That streak culminated with a really big win, worth $19,716, on the last night of the month when she matched all five Cash Five numbers: 5, 14, 21, 30 and 32. "I watched the news that night to see if I won," said Lewallen. "When I saw the numbers, I just yelled 'yahoo' and called my daughters." Lewallen cashed in her winning ticket at the Austin Claim Center, accompanied by her husband of more than 60 years and their three daughters. She said she plans to put most of her winnings in savings, but not before treating the whole family to a lunch out in

Austin. Lewallen also offered some advice for other hopeful Cash Five players. "Just keep playing and play the same numbers," said Lewallen. "I'm glad Mrs. Lewallen's strategy paid off, and I hope she and her family had a great lunch," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "No matter what your strategy though, Cash Five is an extremely accessible game with six drawings a week and the overall odds of winning are really great ­ one in eight!" Lewallen purchased her ticket at the Big Diamond #1378 located at 335 Highway 6 West in Waco.
