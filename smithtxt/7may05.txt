Just Try To Hold These Horses Back - Texas Lottery® Offers Ford Mustang Convertibles In Latest Scratch Game, Mustang Money
(Austin, May 11) - It's the latest addition to the line of scratch games in which the "key" to winning could end up right in your own hand. The Texas Lottery® Mustang Money scratch game offers players a chance to win their very own 2005 Ford Mustang Convertible, with a powerful V6 engine, or to cash in on a $20,000 top prize. "It's the best of both worlds: money or the chance at owning one of the most popular cars of all time," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Players who really appreciate an American automotive legend, like the Ford Mustang, will have a chance at winning one of four convertibles. This car is loaded to the max with special features, and we believe players will stampede their way to the nearest Texas Lottery retailer." Besides the $20,000 top cash prize, the Texas Lottery Mustang Money scratch game offers prizes ranging from $3 to $2,000. There are 12 top cash prizes available to win. The cost to play is $3, and overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 4.36. "In keeping with the road theme we're traveling with this month, I want to let players know about the Texas Road Trip scratch game," said Greer. "The top cash prize is $50,000, and with that kind of money, players could pay for a whole lot of gas for the upcoming summer season." Texas Road Trip will be available to players beginning May 18. The cost to play is $5, and there are three top prizes of $50,000 to win. Overall odds, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 3.46.
