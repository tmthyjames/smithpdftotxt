San Antonio Partnership Megaplies Mega MillionsTM Second-Tier Prize To $1 Million
(Austin, September 14) - BCSM Enterprises, Ltd., STMO Management, Inc., General Partner, L. Don Knight, President, today claimed a $1 million Mega MillionsTM second-tier prize from the August 26 drawing. The claimant's ticket would have been worth $250,000 for matching five of five numbers, but the MegaplierTM option, purchased for an additional dollar, increased the ticket's value to $1 million. "BCSM Enterprises is the second claimant to Megaply their second-tier prize to $1 million since the Mega Millions rule changes took effect in June," said Bobby Heith, media relations director for the Texas Lottery. "With the Mega Millions jackpot up to $250 million, we may well meet some more million-dollar claimants in the near future, but as always, we want to remind everyone to play responsibly." Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 56, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 46. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot. For an extra dollar, the Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times. The ticket presented by BCSM Enterprises, Ltd. was purchased at the Big Diamond #999 located at 4450 DeZavala Rd. in San Antonio. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot will be worth an estimated $250 million.
