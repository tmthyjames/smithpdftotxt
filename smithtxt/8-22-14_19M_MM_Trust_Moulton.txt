HOUSTON TRUST CLAIMS $33 MILLION MEGA MILLIONS® JACKPOT
Winning ticket for June 27 drawing was purchased in Moulton

(AUSTIN) ­ The 6-27-14 Revocable Trust, William J. Rohrbach Jr, Trustee, of Houston claimed the $33 million annuitized jackpot for the June 27 Mega Millions® drawing. The trust selected the cash value option, receiving the prize in one lump sum payment of $19,241,983. The Moulton Grocery & Market, located at 100 S. Lavaca in Moulton, is eligible for a $330,000 bonus for selling the jackpot winning ticket.

The claimant requested minimal publicity. The trust's Quick Pick ticket was the only one to match all five numbers drawn (15­29­31­46­64) and the Bonus Ball (10). In addition to the jackpot prize, Texans won more than 65,000 prizes ranging from $1 to $5,000 for the June 27 drawing.

Texans are once again playing for a large Mega Millions jackpot. The jackpot for the Friday, Aug. 22 drawing is an estimated $180 million with a cash value of $107 million. Mega Millions is played by picking five different numbers from one to 75 and one number from one to
15. To win the Mega Millions jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn including the Mega

Ball. Players matching fewer numbers may not win the jackpot, but still walk away big winners. By choosing the Megaplier® for $1 more per play, players can multiply their non-jackpot winnings by two, three, four or five times, winning as much as $5 million.
