Texas Lottery Commission Recalls Set For Life Instant Ticket Game
(Austin, January 13) - The Texas Lottery Commission announced today that, effective immediately, it is recalling all Set For Life instant tickets (Game #499) from Texas Lottery® retail locations. The agency has identified two tickets where, due to manufacturing errors, prize symbols on the face of the tickets do not match the prize amounts for those tickets in the lottery computer system. The agency's primary instant ticket manufacturer and producer of this game, Scientific Games International, Inc., has indicated to the agency that the problem with this game is not widespread. Players will be able to claim prizes for this game through September 10, 2005. The agency has decided to halt sales of this game to further ensure the continued security and integrity of all Texas Lottery games.
