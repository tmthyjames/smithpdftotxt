Gary Grief Named Acting Executive Director Of Texas Lottery Commission
(Austin, July 11) - The Texas Lottery Commission today named Gary Grief acting executive director of the agency. He was serving as deputy executive director of the agency and assumes his new duties immediately. Grief has been with the Texas Lottery since 1992 and previously served as acting executive director from September 2002 to February 2003. "I am honored that the commissioners this morning have chosen to appoint me acting executive director of the agency," Grief said. The new acting director joined the Texas Lottery as the statewide claim center supervisor in May 1992, and was later named lottery operations director in 1997. He was named deputy executive director of the agency in February of 2003 and oversaw the day-to-day operations of the commission. The three-member commission also announced that they will form a statewide search committee to find the next executive director of the Texas Lottery. This committee may include other state officials and members of the public. Texas Lottery Commission Chair C. Thomas Clowe, Jr., said the creation of the statewide search committee had not been done before by the commission. "We're striving for excellence, and by creating this committee we're reaching out to others in the state to help us find the candidate that will be the best possible fit for the agency." The Texas Lottery supports public education by contributing to the Foundation School Fund.
