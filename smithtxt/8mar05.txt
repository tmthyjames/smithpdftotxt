Lakehills Winner No Longer A Doubting Thomas After $77,000 Triple Action 7's Win

Thomas Brymer of Lakehills won $77,000 on the Triple Action 7's scratch-off game.

(Austin, March 21) - Thomas Brymer of Lakehills didn't believe his Texas Lottery® Triple Action 7's scratch-off ticket was a winner the first time he checked it. But when he went back to his car, he took a second look and realized he'd won the top prize in the $7 game ­ $77,000! "I really didn't know it at first," said Brymer. "Once I realized I'd actually won, I was just in shock!" Soon enough, the shock wore off and Brymer got down to the business of planning what

to do with his winnings. "I'm going to pay off my house and property and car, and put some in savings for my two boys' college education," said Brymer. Brymer, who said he only plays the Games of Texas occasionally, claimed his winnings at the Texas Lottery Claim Center in San Antonio. "Our players are making their own fun while Spring Break is going on," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Our prizes are cause for excitement, whether players win $300, $77,000 or $100,000." In addition to the top prizes of $77,000, the Triple Action 7's game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $7 to $7,000. Brymer purchased his ticket at the Get & Go Markets located at 13041 Bandera Rd. in Helotes.
