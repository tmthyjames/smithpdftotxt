Texas Lottery Commission Adopts Mega Millions Game Changes
(Austin, May 10) - During today's public meeting of the Texas Lottery Commission, the three-member board unanimously voted to adopt proposed rule amendments to the Mega Millions game, with a planned start date for the changes effective June 22, 2005. This action follows an announcement that the California Lottery plans to become the twelfth member state to join the game. "With the addition of California's anticipated increase in the overall sales of Mega Millions, we expect a rapid increase in the Mega Millions jackpot levels per roll cycle," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It's our belief that increases to the jackpot amounts will translate into increased sales and increased revenue to the Foundation School Fund. Since Texas joined Mega Millions in December 2003, the game has generated $382 million in sales and resulted in the transfer of more than $151 million in revenue to the Foundation School Fund in support of public education." The Texas Lottery estimates that incremental revenue to the Foundation School Fund is expected to average more than $15 million per year. The adopted changes to Mega Millions include:

· · ·

NEW MATRIX: Players will choose five numbers from 1 to 56 and then a Mega Ball number from a second field of 1 to 46. HIGHER STARTING JACKPOTS: The starting grand/jackpot prize amount will change from $10 million to $12 million. HIGHER PAYOUTS FOR SECOND AND THIRD TIER PRIZES: The second prize level will change from $175,000 to $250,000 and the third prize level will change from $5,000 to $10,000.

·

ODDS TO WIN GRAND/JACKPOT PRIZE: The odds of matching all the numbers and the Mega Ball for the grand/jackpot prize will change from 1 in 135 million to 1 in 175.7 million.

·

BETTER OVERALL ODDS: The overall odds of winning any prize will be approximately 1 in 40, changing from 1 in 43.

Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $34 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $59 million.
