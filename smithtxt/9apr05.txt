Cameron Bonus Break The Bank Player Rides Lucky Streak To $75,000 Win

Denise Mayer of Cameron won the top prize, $75,000, in the Bonus Break the Bank scratch-off game.

(Austin, April 6) - Denise Mayer of Cameron bought a couple of Texas Lottery® scratchoff tickets last Thursday and won $29. Then she bought a couple more and won $200. Finally, she bought the store's last two Bonus Break the Bank tickets and ­ you guessed it ­ she won again; this time it was the top prize in the $5 game ­ $75,000! "I hardly ever play scratch offs, but I just had a good feeling," said Mayer. "This is hard to believe, but I guess what they say is true: You can't win if you don't play!" The most Mayer, a mother of six (all girls!), had ever won before was $330 in Pick 3. Mayer said she plans to use her Bonus Break the Bank winnings to pay off some bills and

possibly use the remainder for the down payment on a house. "Congratulations to Ms. Mayer on her lucky streak and for her plans to make her 'bonus' pay off for years to come," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And I want to remind all of our players that you don't need to break the bank when you play the Games of Texas. Remember, it only takes one ticket to win, so play responsibly!" In addition to the top prizes of $75,000, the Bonus Break the Bank game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $7,500. Mayer purchased her ticket at the Cam-Rock Quick Stop located at 401 N. Travis Ave. in Cameron.
