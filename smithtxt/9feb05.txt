$50,000 Giant Jumbo Bucks Top Prize Brightens Day For Killeen Winner

Juan Gomez of Killeen won the top prize, $50,000, in the Giant Jumbo Bucks scratch-off game.

(Austin, February 7) - A solid week of Central Texas rain recently resulted in a substantial slowdown in work for construction-business owner Juan Gomez of Killeen. The forecast brightened considerably Friday morning, however, when Gomez realized he held a topprize winning ticket, worth $50,000, for the Texas Lottery® Giant Jumbo Bucks scratchoff game.

Gomez looked at the ticket three or four times before asking the store clerk for confirmation that his eyes weren't fooling him. "I had trouble believing I'd really won at first; I had the clerk check it just to make sure," said Gomez. "This is one of the best days of my life, and it definitely came at a great time." Gomez said he plans to use some of the money to purchase some new equipment for his business and also will set some aside for future rainy days. Gomez said he plays scratchoff games a few times a week and has no intention of stopping now. "Mr. Gomez's wise plans for his windfall should help ensure sunny days ahead for his business," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And his Giant Jumbo Bucks win is proof that every cloud really does have a silver lining." In addition to the top prizes of $50,000, the $5 Giant Jumbo Bucks game offers cash prizes in amounts ranging from $5 to $5,000. Gomez purchased his ticket at the Handy Grocery located at 426 Gilmer St. in Killeen.
