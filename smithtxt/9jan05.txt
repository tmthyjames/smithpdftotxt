Waco Winner's Break The Bank Purchase Results In $30,000 Windfall

Don A. Waddell of Waco won $30,000 playing "Break the Bank" from the Texas Lottery.

(Austin, January 10) - Don A. Waddell of Waco bought a Texas Lottery® instant ticket last Wednesday and scratched it off in his truck. Nothing extraordinary about that, Waddell does the same thing just about every day and has won as much as $200 in the past. This time was different though, as Waddell realized he'd just won $30,000, the top prize for the $2 Break the Bank scratch-off game. "That sure was a pleasant surprise," said Waddell. "But I've always said you never know when you're going to win. I guess it was just my turn." The semi-retired Waddell said he plans to invest some of his winnings and put the rest in the bank. He also plans to keep playing his new favorite game. "I never really had a particular favorite before. Break the Bank is definitely at the top of my list now," said Waddell. "I want to congratulate Mr. Waddell on his good fortune, as well as his plans for his recent winnings," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery

Commission. "I'd also like to remind all of our players to play the Games of Texas responsibly. Remember, it only takes one ticket to win." Waddell purchased his winning ticket at the Cefco Food Store located at 4439 Lakeshore Dr. in Waco. In addition the $30,000 top prize, other Break the Bank cash prizes include: $3,000, $1,000, $200, $50, $20, $12, $10, $8, $6, $4, and $2.
