Estimated $200 Million Jackpot Up For Grabs In Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing!
(Austin, September 12) - No tickets matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball in Friday's Mega MillionsTM drawing, so the jackpot for Tuesday night's drawing will be an estimated $200 million. Two tickets sold in Texas, one each in Brownsville and Pasadena, did match five of five numbers, good for $250,000 each. Statewide, more than 99,000 tickets sold for Friday's drawing matched enough numbers to make them worth a total of more than $1 million. "Tomorrow marks the second time this year that the Mega Millions jackpot has reached the $200 million mark and we know our players will be excited," said Robert Tirloni, products manager for the Texas Lottery. "We just want to remind everyone to play responsibly; remember, it's just a game!" Mega Millions is played in California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Washington. Mega Millions players choose five numbers from 1 to 56, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 46. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $12 million and increases until it is won. The Megaplier option, available only in Texas, allows players to multiply their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times for an extra dollar.
