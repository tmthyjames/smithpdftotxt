ALL OR NOTHING WINS NASPL'S BEST NEW ONLINE GAME
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission's draw game, All or Nothing®, was named Best New Online Game by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL) at the organization's 2013 Annual Conference and Trade Show in Providence, Rhode Island on Oct. 3.

"We are honored to win this award and proud of the game's performance," said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "All or Nothing has exceeded expectations, generating $68.5 million in sales and $39.0 million in prizes to players."

All or Nothing is played by selecting 12 numbers from a pool of 24. Players can win the game's top prize of $250,000 by matching all of the 12 numbers drawn or by matching none of the 12 numbers drawn. In addition to a $250,000 top prize, All or Nothing also offers lower-tier prizes of $2, $10, $50, and $500, depending on how many numbers the player does or does not match.
