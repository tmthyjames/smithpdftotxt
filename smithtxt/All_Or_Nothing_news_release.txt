TEXAS LOTTERY COMMISSION APPROVES NEW ALL OR NOTHING GAME RULE
(AUSTIN) ­ The three-member Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) unanimously voted to approve the new All or Nothing game rule. All or Nothing, scheduled to begin in the fall of 2012, will give lottery players the chance to win up to $250,000 by picking 12 of the 24 numbers drawn or none of the numbers drawn. The object of the game is to either select as many or as few numbers that match the 12 numbers drawn in the drawing. If a player matches more than seven (7) or fewer than five (5) numbers drawn in the drawing, the player wins a prize. If the player matches all 12 numbers drawn in the drawing, or does not match any numbers drawn in the drawing, the player wins the top prize of $250,000. If more than one ticket has been sold in which a player has matched all or none of the numbers drawn in the drawing, each player possessing such ticket shall win the top prize of $250,000. All or Nothing drawings will be held four times a day, at 10:00 a.m., 12:27 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 10:12 p.m. six days a week, Monday through Saturday. Beginning with the first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery® has generated more than $19 billion in revenue for the state and distributed $37 billion in prizes to lottery players. Since 1997, the Texas Lottery has contributed $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. As authorized by the Texas Legislature, certain Texas Lottery revenues benefit state programs including the Fund for Veterans' Assistance. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, the Texas Lottery provides several entertaining games for lottery players including Powerball®, Mega Millions®, Lotto Texas®, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Daily 4TM, Cash Five® and scratch-offs.
