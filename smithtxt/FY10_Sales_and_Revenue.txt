TEXAS LOTTERY® GENERATES BIGGEST RETURN TO STATE SINCE 1998
(AUSTIN) ­The Texas Lottery concluded Fiscal Year 2010 by transferring a total of $1.095 billion to the state of Texas, the largest transfer to the state since 1998. Of that amount, slightly more than $1 billion went directly to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. An additional $7.3 million went to the Texas Veterans Commission from the sales of a new instant scratch-off game dedicated to veterans' assistance. Other state programs benefitted from almost $87 million in unclaimed lottery prizes.

"In the face of a challenging economic environment, total lottery sales in Fiscal Year 2010 were $3.74 billion," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "This represents the fourth best year of sales for the Texas Lottery since ticket sales began in 1992. We're extremely grateful to our loyal players, hard working lottery retailers and dedicated agency staff, all of whom helped us generate this needed revenue."

Grief also cited the following sales highlights for Fiscal Year 2010: · $2.76 billion in instant scratch-off ticket sales, the fifth-highest level of scratch-off sales in the Texas Lottery's history;
·

$255.9 million in Lotto Texas® sales, an increase of $55.4 million from the previous year and the best sales year for Lotto Texas since 2005;

·

$68.5 million in Powerball® sales since its introduction in Texas on January 31, 2010;

· $53.3 million in Daily 4® sales, the best year of sales for this game since its introduction in September 2007;

Fiscal Year 2010 was also a great year for Texas Lottery players. William Kiefer of Katy, Texas, led the way with a Mega Millions® win worth $144 million, but plenty of other Texans from around the state were made millionaires by the Texas Lottery this year. Prizes of $1 million or more were awarded to 44 lucky Texas Lottery players. In all, the Texas Lottery paid out almost $2.3 billion in prizes this year.

Lottery retailers also hit the jackpot in Fiscal Year 2010, earning more than $187 million in commissions and bonuses for selling lottery tickets.

"Bottom line, 95% of the Texas Lottery's $3.74 billion in sales was returned to the state and players in the form of prizes, contributions to the Foundation School Fund, retailer bonuses and commissions, and other state programs," said Grief.
