  TEXAS LOTTERY INVALIDATES JUMBO BUCKS III NOVEMBER SECOND-CHANCE DRAWINGS, SCHEDULES NEW DRAWINGS
TEXAS LOTTERY VENDOR TO PAY PLAYERS WHOSE ENTRIES WERE SELECTED IN NOVEMBER DRAWINGS

(Austin) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has invalidated the November 2 and 3 Jumbo Bucks III second-chance drawings after discovering entries for the different games inadvertently were commingled before the drawings. In response to a complaint, the TLC conducted a thorough review of the drawings, which has prompted the TLC's executive director to invalidate the November 2 and 3 drawings. The TLC's primary instant ticket manufacturer, Scientific Games International, Inc. (SGI), conducted the drawings and will honor the entries selected. SGI also will conduct new drawings at the direction of the TLC. "We are pleased with the decision by Scientific Games to pay the lottery players whose names were selected in the November 2 and 3 drawings and to conduct new drawings," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Gary Grief. "Scientific Games takes its commitment and responsibility to the Texas Lottery and our players seriously. In making this decision to honor the original entries selected, Scientific Games has demonstrated their joint commitment with the Texas Lottery to the integrity and security of our games and the public trust we must maintain with our lottery players." Players that entered these drawings can visit the Jumbo Bucks III game page on the Texas Lottery website, www.txlottery.org, to determine if their entries were selected in the November drawings. The Texas Lottery will also proactively contact all entrants selected and notify them of the payment process that will be utilized by Scientific Games. (more)
