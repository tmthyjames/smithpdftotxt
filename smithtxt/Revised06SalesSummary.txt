TEXAS LOTTERY SETS NEW SALES RECORD, GENERATES MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR TEXAS EDUCATION
(AUSTIN) ­ The Texas Lottery Commission today reported reaching the highest level of total sales in its 14-year history. Unaudited sales totaled more than $3.774 billion for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 (September 1, 2005, thru August 31, 2006), and resulted in cash transfers of more than $1.029 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas. "I believe this year's record sales are a direct result of the exemplary teamwork of our talented staff, which continues to work closely with the more than 16,000 retailers who play such an integral role in helping the Texas Lottery fulfill its mission of supporting Texas education," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. "I think this is an accomplishment we can all be proud of, but of course, what's most impressive about our unprecedented sales is that they generated more than $1 billion for the Foundation School Fund for the third consecutive year." Sales for all Texas Lottery® products were up 3.1 percent over FY 2005. Players claimed prizes in excess of $2.3 billion, and Texas Lottery retailers earned more than $191 million in commissions and bonuses. The sales of Texas Lottery instant tickets totaled more than $2.8 billion, a 5.8 percent increase over last year's $2.7 billion, and accounted for 75.8 percent of total FY 2006 sales. Lotto Texas® totaled more than $241 million in sales, down from $306.7 million in FY 2005. The lottery's flag-ship game accounted for 6.4 percent of total sales.

Texas' own Megaplier® feature, which allows players the chance to double, triple or quadruple a nonjackpot prize, accounted for more than $46 million in FY 2006 sales, a 16 percent increase over last year. The Pick 3® game showed yet another rise in player participation over previous years, with more than $295 million in total sales, an increase of 3.7 percent from last year, marking the 12th consecutive year of growth for this game. Cash Five® accounted for more than $90 million in sales, a 12.1 percent decrease, and Texas Two Step® sales totaled more than $47 million, a 5.1 percent increase. "While the past fiscal year was successful in terms of total sales and transfers, we will continue to look at some additional features on existing games and possible new game ideas for this next fiscal year," said Sadberry.
