TEXAS LOTTERY® CELEBRATES 18TH ANNIVERSARY
(Austin) ­ Since the sale of the first lottery ticket on May 29, 1992, the Texas Lottery® has been among the top lotteries in the industry, all the while fulfilling its mission to generate revenue for education in the state of Texas. "The milestones that the agency has achieved over the past 18 years are a direct result of the hard work and determination of the Texas Lottery staff and our almost 17,000 licensed retailers across the state," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. A few of the milestones achieved through April 30, 2010 are: · · · · Over $57 billion in total sales. Over $33 billion in prizes paid to players. Over $17 billion in transfers to the State since 1992. Over $2.9 billion paid to retailers in commissions and bonuses.

Grief attributed much of the agency's success to providing an entertaining and exciting game mix for Texas Lottery players, while maintaining a high level of fairness, integrity and security. "Our scratch-off games offer price points from $1 to $50 with instant top prizes ranging up to $10 million," he said. "With the recent addition of Powerball to the existing game lineup, we feel we have an overall game mix that meets the needs of all our players." Drawings are held twice a week for Powerball, Mega Millions®, Lotto Texas®, and Texas Two Step®. Cash 5® drawings are held six nights a week, and drawings are held twice daily, Monday through Saturday, for Pick 3TM and Daily 4TM.
