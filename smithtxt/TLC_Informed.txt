(AUSTIN) ­ Officials of the Texas Lottery were notified of the death of Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Anthony J. Sadberry. The Commissioners and staff of the Texas Lottery Commission offer their condolences to Mr. Sadberry's family. "Anthony Sadberry was dedicated to his profession and service to the state of Texas," said Jim Cox, Chairman of the Texas Lottery Commission. "His contribution to the organization and the image of the Texas Lottery is both noteworthy and greatly appreciated." Mr. Sadberry had 10 years of service with the Commission beginning as a commissioner appointed by Governor Ann Richards in November 1993 and serving in that capacity until March 2001. He was commission chair from October 1994 to August 1995. He then became Acting Executive Director in January 2006 and was named executive director in June 2006. Mr. Sadberry held that position until his death. In a recent interview, Mr. Sadberry spoke of his belief that while conducting his duties as executive director he should maintain an open mind and an open door, remembering his position was to serve the state and not his personal interests. ...
