Blame $4.7 Million Lotto Texas Win For Texas Sesame Seed Shortage
(Austin, April 30) - - Today, the 17-member group of Sesame Solutions Lottery Trust of Paris arrived at the Texas Lottery Commission to claim their $4,726,901 jackpot prize from the drawing held April 24, worth an estimated $17 million.

The 17 members of the Sesame Solutions Lottery Trust of Paris, Texas.

"There'll be a shortage of sesame seeds on buns this week," said Glenn Smith, spokesperson for Sesame Solutions Lottery Trust. "The whole company will be shut down while we're in Austin." The trust is mostly made up of co-workers from Sesame Solutions. The company is the only sesame seed processing plant in the U.S. for the baking industry. Some in the group have worked together for almost 20 years. Smith, Vice-President of Sesame Solutions, told lottery officials that the group found out about the jackpot-winning ticket the morning following the drawing. Group member Barbara Gilliam called a local lottery retailer to get the winning numbers, and then checked the group's tickets. She began calling people with the news that one of the tickets had matched all six numbers. "Total shock at first, then no one believed us," said Gilliam. "They eventually did." "I knew as soon as Barbara called to tell me," Smith said. "I had such a strong feeling the day before about winning. This couldn't have gone to a better group. Of course, I can say that because I'm a part of it (the trust)." The ticket was purchased at Food Fast #95, located at 707 Bonham Street in Paris. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent - $85,000 - for selling a jackpot-winning Lotto Texas ticket. "A lot of us are going to do some home improvements or buy new homes," said Smith. "We'll spend some, save some, and give some. One thing, this group is going to be smart about this. I'm sure most of this money will stay in Paris, because that's where we're from."

The ticket was one of two winning Lotto tickets for the drawing. The other ticket was bought at K-C Oil #6, located at 2906 Central Expressway in Wichita Falls. The retailer is also eligible for a bonus of $85,000. Both jackpot-winning tickets were purchased with the Cash Value Option, which will net the winner(s) $4,726,901. "The only thing I want to say, 'Jerry, I need a VIP pass for (Dallas Cowboys) training camp this year. Thank you,'" said David Harris, a Sesame Solutions Lottery Trust member. As of today, the second jackpot-winning Lotto ticket from the April 24 drawing has not yet been claimed. The winning numbers drawn were: 10 - 11 - 13 - 25 - 35 - 39. The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $6 million.
