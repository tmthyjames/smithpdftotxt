Pick 3 Day Drawing Debuts
(Austin, April 29) - - Today marks the debut of the Texas Lottery Commission's first ever Pick 3 Day Drawing. Ticket sales, which began yesterday, totaled $191,760. The daytime drawings will occur Monday through Saturday at 12:27 p.m.

The first-ever Pick 3 Day drawing at 12:27 p.m. on Monday, April 29, 2002.

"This is a historical day for the Texas Lottery Commission," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud. "We expect this new daytime addition to Pick 3 to be as successful as the nighttime game has been in the past. We're projecting up to a six percent increase in total sales for each year, or approximately $4.6 million in estimated additional revenue for the state." Pick 3, the Texas Lottery's second online game introduced in 1993, has consistently experienced an increase in sales every year since its inception. The following table shows sales totals from startup for each Fiscal Year (FY):

Out of 35 U.S. lotteries that participate in a Pick 3-style game, 12 of those also offer a mid-day drawing. "Our Pick 3 players will now get to play the game they love twice a day, and lottery retailers will get the added benefit of increased foot traffic in their stores," said Cloud. "The day and night drawings will be a winning combination for everyone." There will be no changes to the way Pick 3 is currently played. Players will still select three numbers each from "0" to "9," with four choices for how they can play their 3-digit combination (Exact Order, Any Order, Exact/Any Order or Combo). Cost to play will remain as little as 50 cents for a single Exact or Any Order play, or as much as $360 on a Combo play where the numbers are played for twelve draws. Currently, Texas' Pick 3 sales lead all U.S. lotteries west of the Mississippi River.
