Texas Two Step Winner Finally Getting Some Sleep
(Austin, April 26) - - Danny Letterman can finally start getting some sleep. Today, the 34-year-old Andrews resident collected his $1.25 million Texas Two Step jackpot prize from the drawing held on April 17.

"It's only been since this past Monday that I've gotten to sleep all the way through the night," said Letterman. "It's been crazy." Letterman and his wife, Lori, told lottery officials they typically choose their numbers, however, when it came time to buy their tickets for the drawing, Lori couldn't find the playslip they had marked. "We got $5 worth of Quick Picks instead," Letterman explained. "We like to play when the jackpot gets high." The two were at home the evening of the Texas Two Step drawing, and Letterman explained his wife was watching the drawing on KWES-TV (Midland), but missed the Bonus Ball number. "We pulled up the lottery website, it's (bookmarked) on our favorites list, and checked the numbers there," Lori said. "He still didn't believe it though, and so we went down to the store and asked the retailer for the numbers also." Letterman added, "We walked out of there real quietly when we saw the results." The Lettermans purchased their winning ticket at One Stop Food #3, at Northwest 11th Street and West Broad in Andrews. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the Texas Two Step jackpot winning ticket. Letterman makes the 49th Texas Two Step jackpot winner since the game began in May 2001. The April 17 drawing marked the seventh time the Texas Two Step jackpot has reached more than $1 million. Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is $400,000.
