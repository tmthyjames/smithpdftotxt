Cash Five - Same Name (Sort Of), New Game (Definitely)
(Austin, April 26) - Players might notice the slight name change. They'll definitely notice the great new odds of winning and the new prize amounts to the Texas Lottery's on-line game - Cash Five. "Since the Texas Lottery began, players have been saying the same thing to us. They want games that are easy to win and have great prizes," said Robert Tirloni, On-line Product Manager of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We've found another great match for them - the new Cash Five game change will offer great odds, and players can win $2 for matching only two of five numbers." Players will see their overall odds of winning Cash Five change from 1 in 100 to 1 in 8. The Cash Five change will make Texas the only state in the U.S. to have a 5-digit game that gives a $2 cash prize for matching only two numbers. With the new Cash Five changes, players will choose five numbers from one to 37. Players can win prizes for matching two, three, four, or five numbers. All prizes will be pari-mutuel except the guaranteed $2 prize. There will be approximately 54,000 winners per drawing, and the cost to play will continue to be $1. "The Texas Lottery Commission is projecting a 10-percent increase in sales with the new Cash Five changes," Tirloni said. "That means approximately $4 - $5 million in additional revenue for the state." Sales for the new Cash Five game will begin on Sunday, July 28, with the first drawing to take place on Monday, July 29. Drawings will take place six nights a week, Monday through Saturday at 9:59 p.m.
