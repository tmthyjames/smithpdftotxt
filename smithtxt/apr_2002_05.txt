Texas Lottery Scratch-Off Player Turns $50 Into $100,000
(Austin, April 26) - - How would you like to turn $10 into a $99,990 profit? That's exactly what Josephine Garcia McCann of Poteet did after spending $10 on a single Texas Lottery scratch-off ticket - the 10th Anniversary Game. I originally won $50, and thought I'd just turn it back in and try my luck (again)," said McCann. "At first, I thought I had won $10,000 not $100,000. My co-workers were the ones who convinced me." McCann bought her tickets at Kuntry Korner Steak, located at IH 37 South and Jim Brite Road in Pleasanton. McCann works as a front desk clerk at an adjoining motel. "I buy all my games there," McCann said. "I mostly buy the $10 and $5 games. You might spend a little more, but you get a lot more if you win. I'm going to pay off some bills and maybe look for a house." The Texas Lottery's 10th Anniversary Game was introduced last month in celebration of the 10 years of the 'Games of Texas.' Players can win up to 12 times on one ticket, with a top-prize of $100,000. Overall odds of winning any prize on the Texas Lottery 10th Anniversary Game are 1 in 2.46.
