A "Love" Fest at Sanger Texas Lottery Retailer
(Austin, April 10) - - In Sanger today it was all about Love - Love's Country Store that is. The Texas Lottery retailer was presented with a ceremonial retailer bonus check in the amount of $40,000 for selling a jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket. The lottery retailer is located at 8900 I-35 in Sanger.

"After hearing about the winning ticket, we thought, 'Oh, cool,' said Jenny Love Meyer, Public Relations Director, Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores. "We checked with the lottery to make sure we had sold the winning one." The Quick Pick ticket was purchased for the Lotto drawing held on January 23, 2002, worth an estimated $4 million. The winner of the jackpot, Ken Ontko of Oklahoma City, claimed his prize on February 6, and received a total payout of $2,226,038.40 before taxes. Besides this one-percent bonus of $40,000, Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores has received two other retailer bonuses. A Cash 5 ticket sold in November 1999 worth $25,742 netted the retailer $257.42. A jackpot winning Texas Two Step ticket sold in June 2001 worth $250,000 earned the retail owner $2,500. "Being a part of the Texas Lottery really means something," Love Meyer said. "We're contributing to the education system." On hand for the ceremonial check presentation were Love's Country Store Manager, David Feike, and Texas Lottery Commission On-Line Product Manager, Robert Tirloni. "The Texas Lottery is happy to present this retailer bonus to Love's Country Store," said Tirloni.
