Beginner's Luck Wins Player $13,141 Prize In Texas LotteryTM Drawing

Kevin Ross Blackburn of Durant, Oklahoma, stands with his prize check.

(Austin, April 25) - Talk about beginner's luck: Kevin Ross Blackburn from Durant, Oklahoma, had played Cash Five only three times when he matched all five numbers in the April 12 drawing, winning a $13,137 share of the Texas Lottery game's top prize. In addition, he also won $4 by matching two numbers on two other lines on his ticket. "This is the most I've ever won in anything," explained Blackburn. "My dad plays Cash Five a lot and suggested I give it a try. I have played the Harley-Davidson® scratch-off game and have won $20 and $40." "What a neat deal for Kevin. Now he has some serious walking-around money," said Reagan Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "It's no wonder our new players decide to try Cash Five. Since the game changed, it has produced 229 topprize winners." Blackburn, an Oklahoman who says he crosses into Texas frequently as a dry-wall installer, purchased his Quick Pick ticket at Red River Grocery, 12 miles north of Bonham in Ravenna. The retailer is eligible to receive a 1 percent bonus of $131.37 for selling the winning ticket. The winning numbers drawn were: 3 - 13 - 27 - 8 - 6. Three tickets matched the drawn numbers, and each winner shared a total of $39,411. The other two tickets were sold in Seguin and Houston. As a new player who only started participating in July when he turned 18, Blackburn said he didn't even check the numbers until his father reminded him, and then realized he won big four days after the drawing. "I realized I won on Thursday, but with the holiday, I couldn't collect my prize at the Claim Center in Sherman until a week after the drawing," he said.

With no pressing needs, Blackburn said he plans on spending the money, mostly on his girlfriend, and perhaps on a trip. "I know that I'll keep playing Texas Lottery games," he said. "I'll stick to Cash Five." Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
