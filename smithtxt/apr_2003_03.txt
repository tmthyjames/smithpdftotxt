Big Sales Day Expected for Tonight's $35 Million Lotto TexasTM Jackpot
(Austin, April 23) - With tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot at $35 million, the Texas Lottery Commission is expecting today's sales to be in the $7 million to $8 million range. At today's meeting of the Texas Lottery Commission, Chairman C. Tom Clowe, Jr., noted that the sales projection is an indication that players are interested in higher jackpots. "When we have a $4 million to $5 million jackpot, sales are $7 million to $8 million for the week," Clowe said. "We're looking at the possibility of a $7 million to $8 million sales day. That tells me that players are voting with their purchases and it is heavily weighted towards bigger jackpots." The Commission recently voted to change the matrix on the Lotto Texas game in order to increase the possibility of larger jackpots. Sales for the new game start May 4, with the first drawing on May 7. The last drawing for the current Lotto game, where players match 6 of 6 numbers to win the jackpot, is May 3. Tonight's drawing will take place at 10:12 p.m. This Lotto Texas jackpot is the largest since March 19, 2003, when the jackpot was also an estimated $35 million. It is also currently the fifth-highest lottery jackpot in the United States.
