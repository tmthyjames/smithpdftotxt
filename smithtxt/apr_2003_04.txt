(Austin, April 18) - Sonia Reid got the extra boost she says she needed to make her goal in life come true. Reid won the top cash prize for the Texas LotteryTM instant ticket, Crossword, and collected $35,000 today at the Sherman Claim Center. "I'm going out to get me a computer, sign up for school, and become a social worker," Reid explained. "This money is giving me the opportunity to do what I want, and I'll be able to give something back because of it. This was the boost and push that I needed." "We are so thrilled for Sonia," said Reagan Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's such a tremendous pleasure to hear how she plans to use her prize to get her degree and give back to the community this way." The Greenville resident purchased her winning ticket at Super 1 Stop Food Store, located at 1313 North Church Street in McKinney. Crossword has been issued three times since its debut in June 2002. As of April 12, there are two top prizes of $35,000 remaining in the re-issued game. "My husband and I both love the game. When they (Texas Lottery) brought it back, we were so excited," Reid said. "We play it a lot, and we got the one we needed. "I'm still floating," she added.
