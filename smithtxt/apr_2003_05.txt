(Midland, April 17) - Today, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer presented a ceremonial retailer bonus check in the amount of $50,000 to Southwest Convenience Stores, owner of 7-Eleven #814, located at 4324 Andrews Highway in Midland. The retail location sold the jackpot-winning Lotto TexasTM ticket for the drawing held on February 12, worth $5 million. As of today, this is the sixth retail location in the Midland/Odessa area to achieve that accomplishment. "One aspect sometimes overlooked when a community has a jackpot- winning ticket is the bonus the retailer receives," said Greer. "Retailers are the valuable link between the Texas Lottery and our players. We feel the best way to reward and recognize our retailers for selling jackpot-winning tickets is to provide bonuses like today's $50,000." Retailers in the Midland/Odessa area have earned more than $785,000 in bonuses. In the 10-year history of the Texas Lottery, total sales for the area have been more than $173 million. On hand to accept the ceremonial check for Southwest Convenience Stores were Lisa Crosby, Category Manager; George Fairman, Director of Marketing; and Susan Marts, Midland District Manager. Crosby echoed Greer's enthusiasm for what the bonus means for the store, the company and its employees. "We gave each of the employees in this particular store a bonus, and the rest of the money will be used to fund additional lottery promotions," she said. The prizewinner for the $5 million jackpot, Brenda Lee Anderson of Midland, claimed her prize on March 3. She chose the Cash Value Option payment and received more than $3 million, before taxes.
