(Austin, April 11) - For 29-year-old Stephanie Kincade, today became very special. Instead of pocketing money from the Texas Lottery Commission, she drove her prize right off the Texas LotteryTM Tyler Claim Center parking lot. Kincade became the 11th instant winner for a Ford F-150 SuperCab XLT pickup truck with the Bucks 'N Trucks II scratch-off game. "This is my first new truck or car, period," said Kincade. "I couldn't believe I had won. I actually walked out of the store, leaving the other tickets I had bought on the counter." The Jacksonville resident bought her ticket at Champs Convenience Store, located at 329 North Bolton in Jacksonville. "Thank you, thank you, thank you, Texas Lottery," she said. Bucks 'N Trucks II offers players the chance to win a 2003 Ford F-150 SuperCab XLT pickup truck in bright red. There are a total of four Ford trucks left to win. "It seems every Texan would like to drive a truck someday," said Reagan Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "With the Bucks 'N Trucks II scratch-off, the Texas Lottery is giving our players that opportunity or the chance to win one of the 36 cash prizes of $1,000 that are still out there." The game also gives players a chance to win a top cash prize of $1,000. The cost to play Bucks 'N Trucks II is $2. The odds of winning either a truck prize or any cash prize are 1 in 4.74, including break-even prizes. "Believe me, you can win too, if you play," said Kincade. "I'm going to keep on."
