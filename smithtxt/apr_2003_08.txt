New Braunfels Woman Runs Errand For Dad-- Takes Home $5,000 In Texas LotteryTM Instant Game

Irene Ramirez wins on the Texas Lottery Armadillo Dollars scratch-off game.

(Austin, April 11) - "Obey your parents" may be the advice Irene Ramirez gives others after winning $5,000 as a result of doing what her dad asked. The New Braunfels woman recently won the top prize on Armadillo Dollars from the Texas LotteryTM after buying a few of the scratch-off tickets requested by her father, and buying a few of her own. "My uncle had won $500 on the Armadillo Dollars game and Dad wanted some," explained Ramirez. "I bought 10; he kept four and I kept six. But I was just trying it out. The most I've ever won was $50, so I was really shaking when I realized I won." "Somewhere in Texas there are still 48 top-prize winning tickets left in the Armadillo Dollars scratch-off game," said Reagan Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "We've already given the top $5,000 cash prize to 15 of our Texas Lottery players since the game started on March 19." Ramirez purchased her winning ticket at Fastway Food Mart, located at 1412 Common in New Braunfels. Her big splurge with the extra cash? "I'm finally going to be able to buy my two children a Power Wheels," said Ramirez. "And if I could tell other players something, it would be that anyone could win, because I did. Now, I am a believer." Armadillo Dollars hit retail stores March 19 and includes prizes of $1, $2, $4, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, and $5,000.
