Texas Lottery Commission Gives San Antonio Retailer $50,000 Bonus And Wonders: Where Is That Jackpot Winner?

Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer speaking at the San Antonio retailer check presentation.

(San Antonio, April 3) - Today, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer gave a ceremonial bonus check to the San Antonio Diamond Shamrock store that sold the winning jackpot ticket for the January 29 Lotto TexasTM drawing. But the person or group who bought that ticket has not come forward yet, and Greer said, "That's unusual." "It's been 64 days since the drawing for this $5 million jackpot, and we haven't heard from anyone yet," said Greer. "Whoever bought the ticket chose the Cash Value Option, so someone out there has a ticket that's worth more than $3 million, before taxes." Greer, a native of San Antonio, presented the ceremonial bonus check of $50,000 to the retailer that sold the winning ticket, Diamond Shamrock Corner Store, located at 1002 Castroville Road in San Antonio. "We are thrilled to present a bonus check to Valero Energy and recognize the efforts of its store employees in selling this jackpot winning ticket," said Greer. "Our retailers and their employees play such a big part in the success of our lottery games that it's always exciting to congratulate them for selling a jackpot-winning ticket. The only thing that would be more exciting is if someone walks in right now with that ticket." Retail owners are eligible for a 1 percent bonus for selling a winning jackpot ticket. "All of us here at Valero are very excited that one of our customers was fortunate enough to win the Texas Lottery," said Valero Energy Zone Manager Mark Haley as he accepted the ceremonial check. "It's good for the customers, it's good for the community, and it's good for the store as our employees get to share in the winnings. We're very pleased to be a lottery outlet and we hope that all our customers come in and win again." While the identity of who has the ticket is still unknown, lottery officials know this much about the ticket:

It was purchased for the January 29 drawing. The jackpot that night was worth $5 million. The buyer selected the Cash Value Option, making the ticket worth $3,015,708, before taxes. The player chose the numbers. The numbers drawn were: 37-04-12-33-52-22. Lotto Texas players have 180 days after the date of a drawing to claim a prize. This ticket will expire July 28, at midnight.

"We encourage all our players to look for their old tickets. Look in the car, under cushions, behind the refrigerator, anywhere an old ticket may have been placed and check those numbers for the January 29 drawing!" said Greer. "I want to reinforce to people that if they are visiting San Antonio and if they're from out of the country or from out of the state that they have a right to win. Anybody can play and win the Texas Lottery," he said. Individuals who believe they have the winning Lotto Texas ticket should call the Texas Lottery at 1-800-37LOTTO or 1-800375-6886 and speak to the Winners Information Specialist, and find out what to do next. A previous San Antonio winner currently holds the record for waiting the longest to claim a Lotto Texas prize. Robert Wantland Family Investments, Ltd., waited 147 days to claim the $8 million jackpot prize on February 12, 1997. The drawing was held on September 18, 1996. If the ticket is not claimed by the 180-day deadline, the prize money will be transferred to the Tertiary Care Facility Account, to help the state pay for indigent healthcare. Since September 1, 1999, all unclaimed prize money is sent to one of two funds. The Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account is allowed $40 million per biennium. After the $40 million is met, the money is transferred solely to the Tertiary Care Facility Account. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $13 million.
