Third Million Dollar Winner For Texas Lottery® Casino Action Scratch Off Game
(Austin, April 30) - Daniel Rodriguez of San Antonio today claimed the top cash prize, one million dollars, for the Texas Lottery Casino Action scratch off game. The game has consistently ranked in the top 10 most popular instant games since its release on January 23, 2004. "Mr. Rodriguez is the second top prize winner for the Casino Action game, and the also the second one from the Central Texas area," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The popularity of the game is due in large part to our goal in giving players a chance at a large, instant cash prize, and at the same time offers them other big payouts at the smaller prize levels." Sales for Casino Action have totaled more than $51 million since its launch. Instant ticket sales are up 6.1 percent over last year during this time. "Our Lottery retailers really like the game, too, because it offers a bonus of $10,000 to the owners that sell one of the top prize winning tickets," said Greer. Rodriguez purchased his prize winning ticket at the For Your Convenience store, located at 6206 Pecan Valley in San Antonio. As of today, there are no $1 million prize left to claim. As of week ending April 24, 2004, other cash prizes left to claim for the game are: PRIZE LEVEL $100,000 $10,000 $4,000 $2,000 $1,000 $400 $200 $100 $80 $40 $20 NUMBER LEFT TO CLAIM 0 2 15 23 70 1,229 4,070 7,068 13,244 27,423 134,533

"We plan to continue giving players games they enjoy scratching," said Greer. "We're celebrating our twelfth anniversary in May, and to commemorate the occasion, we've started sales for the 12th Anniversary Million instant ticket, where we're giving away another top cash prize of one million dollars. Looking ahead to the summer, we're working on ticket ideas that will include a Monopoly game theme, and a Tabasco-themed game."
