Houston Man Claims $700,000 Mega MillionsTM Prize; Divides With Group Who Pitched In

Daniel Duncan of Houston, claimant of the $700,000 Mega Millions megaplied prize.

(Austin, April 29) - Daniel Duncan got his checkbook ready to work hard late Wednesday. He claimed the $700,000 Mega MillionsTM megaplied prize from the April 27 drawing at the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Houston, and then divided the prize among the 19 other winners in his Lottery-playing group at work. "Finally, we hit it," Duncan said. "We're 20 in our group, and we pitch in every week for our favorite games. Right now, it's Mega Millions." Duncan and his fellow workers are employed at Enterprise Transportation Trucking Company, a subsidiary of Enterprise Products in Houston. "Perseverance has paid off for Mr. Duncan and his co-workers," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We're always happy to see a large group win because the prize helps spread the joy around a lot more. The winner and his friends made sure they megaplied their ticket and it paid off handsomely for them." The winning numbers were 10-35-17-1-23, and the bonus ball was 45. The MegaplierTM number was four. By purchasing the Megaplier feature, a player can multiply by two, three or four times any prize that isn't the jackpot. The ticket was purchased at the Sunny Food Store, 2776 WTC Jester Boulevard, in Houston. Denise Offenhhauser, another member of the group, has the duty of checking the numbers on the group's tickets the morning after the drawings. "I'm the first one in the office, so I do the checking, and when I saw those numbers in the (Houston) Chronicle, I immediately

wanted to know which person was playing a joke on me," she said. "Then I realized we had the numbers, and that's when I started getting hot flashes. Then, I started hollering and screaming." There are 1,000 employees in two buildings where the winner and the group work. It wasn't long before everybody at Enterprise Trucking knew what had happened. Offenhauser said the group members she's talked to have all said they're using their share of the prize to off bills. "Danny figured out on a paper napkin that we're all going to get about $26,250," she said. "Lots of people have congratulated us," said Patricia Crawford, the member of the group whose job it is to buy the tickets. "I collect the money and buy the tickets. We had $22, so I bought 11 Quick Pick tickets and megaplied every one of them. And we've played them all, from Lotto, to Cash 5 to Texas Two Step and now Mega Millions. It's nice to know you can win." The group has been playing since 1992 when there were only five members and the Lotto TexasTM game was new. Since then, members have drifted in and out of the group. Crawford said that as an extra measure of security, the players insist on leaving the tickets locked up at the office. "It's just safety, that way nobody's got them. They're locked up." "I'm sure there will be new persons at work wanting to join this winning group," said Greer. "After all, there's nothing like a big win to attract attention. It's like the 'lucky store' syndrome; people like to buy Lottery tickets where a winning ticket with a big prize was sold. It's the same with a winner, in this case a big group of friendly folks who enjoy playing 'The Games of Texas.'" Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $45 million. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $40 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
