Mega MillionsTM Winner Has Big Plans For $175,000 Prize, Including Trip To Mcdonald's For Friend

Kenneth Pfister said he's proud to be the latest Mega Millions winner. He collected $175,000 from the Texas Lottery Tyler Claim Center.

(Austin, April 29) - Texas Lottery® winners really know how to live it up. That includes Kenneth Pfister, Jr., of Texarkana, Arkansas, who just claimed his $175,000 Mega MillionsTM cash prize yesterday afternoon. He plans on taking his buddy, Peter, to McDonald's for a Big Mac. "We've always teased each other that if either of us won, we had to go to McDonald's," said Pfister. "I'm making him pay for his own cheese though; I didn't agree to that." Pfister said his other plans include paying off bills and buying his wife a brand new car. "I've heard of trips to Disney or cruises to somewhere exotic from our winners, but this is a first for a trip to McDonald's," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "I'm glad to hear that Mr. Pfister has some other plans for his big win as well. I heard that he and his wife are going to look for a new sports utility vehicle to help carry around all their grandkids. That sounds like a goal really worth accomplishing."
