Albany Woman Claims Million Dollar Prize From Texas Lottery®

Connie Kitchens and her husband are Texas' newest millionaires - she won the top cash prize for the Texas Lottery's Casino Action scratch off game.

(Austin, April 27) - It's official. Connie Kitchens of Albany, Texas, is the second million dollar winner from the Texas Lottery's scratch off game, Casino Action. Kitchens bought the winning ticket last week. She had just finished her shift at Allsup's Convenience Store in Albany, when she decided to buy the new $20 ticket from the Texas Lottery® with the $30 she had just won on another scratch off game. "I had just clocked out and decided to take another chance, so I bought Casino Action," she recalled, when she came to Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin today to claim her prize. "I saw that my numbers matched and turned to my boss and said, 'Does this say what I think it does?' " Lottery officials confirmed today that the Casino Action ticket she bought was the second million dollar ticket for this game, making Kitchens an "instant" millionaire. Her prize comes to $750,000, after taxes. Kitchens said that within minutes the whole town knew of her good luck. "It's a small town and word travels fast," she said. "Someone told me every store in town had sold out of Casino Action." Albany isn't the only place this ticket is a "hot seller."
