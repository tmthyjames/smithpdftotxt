First Winner Claims Top Prize For Texas Lottery® $130,000 Bonus Scratch Game

Janetta Bowie accepts her $130,000 cash prize from Texas Lottery Commission Marketing Director Steve Martin.

(Austin, April 27) - Janetta Bowie of Houston today became the first winner to claim the top cash prize of the Texas Lottery® $130,000 Bonus scratch off game. The $5 ticket allows players the chance to collect $500 a week for five years. The total cash payout is $130,000, before taxes. "I always buy the new tickets," Bowie said. "I bought one Break the Bank and one $130,000 Bonus. I won four dollars on the Break the Bank and decided to buy one more $130,000 Bonus. I scratched it in my car, and won." As of today, there are four top cash prizes still unclaimed for the $130,000 Bonus game. Other cash prizes for the game are: $1000, $500, $100, $75, $50, $30, $15, $10 and $5. "Our player research has shown that the idea of winning a certain dollar amount every week really grabs our players' attention," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Just take a look at our Weekly Grand scratch off game. It's a perfect example of how much Texans like the idea of winning a prize paid out over time. It's been reissued a total of 13 times since 1995." "This new instant ticket has really gotten players excited," said Greer. "In its first week, the game ranked third among our instant tickets with sales totaling more than $2.3 million. Bowie told lottery officials that she plans to pay off bills with her winnings. "I even bought two or three more on my way here,"
