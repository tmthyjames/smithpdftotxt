Texas Lottery® Instant Ticket Winner Gives A Whole New Meaning To 'Time Is Money'

Wynetta Johnson of Fort Worth claims top cash prize with $50,000 Cash Bonanza.

(Austin, April 22) - Fort Worth resident, Wynetta Johnson seems to follow the sage belief of one Donald Trump - 'Time is money.' Johnson purchased a Texas Lottery® scratch game, $50,000 Cash Bonanza, around 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon. By 4 p. m., she was at the Texas Lottery Fort Worth Claim Center claiming the top cash prize of $50,000. "I'm living in the moment," said Johnson. "I didn't want to take any chances of losing this ticket, so I came right away. It's been very windy here, you know." Johnson claimed the final $50,000 top-prize for the game. As of today, there is still one $5,000 prize as yet unclaimed. "It sounds like Wynetta isn't the type to let any grass grow under her feet," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I'm sure she didn't waste any time getting to the bank yesterday either. Congratulations to her and her husband on their big win." Johnson explained to lottery officials that it was the first time she had ever purchased the $5 scratch off game. "Low and behold, it turned out to be a winner," she said. "This has been very exciting." For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
