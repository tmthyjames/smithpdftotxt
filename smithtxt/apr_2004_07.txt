Mesquite Man Matches All Five Numbers For His Favorite Texas Lottery® Game - Cash FiveTM

After collecting his top Cash Five prize, Juan Gasca said he plans to start looking for a new home.

(Austin, April 19) - Juan Gasca spent Saturday morning reading The Dallas Morning News for the Texas Lottery® drawing results for Friday night's games. He read over the Pick 3TM, Texas Two Step® and Cash FiveTM results, and then spent the rest of the morning in disbelief. That's because he realized he had matched all five numbers on his favorite game - Cash Five. "I play Cash Five every day. I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked at the numbers. I had to have my wife look at the ticket, too," Gasca explained. "After that, I still went to the retail store where I bought it and had the clerk verify it." Today, Gasca collected his cash prize, $21,278, before taxes, at the Texas Lottery Dallas Claim Center. He purchased the fiveof-five matching ticket at Sadler's Food Mart #2, located at 1526 Hickory Tree Road in Mesquite. The retail owner is eligible for a bonus of $212.78 for selling the winning Cash Five ticket. "Mr. Gasca was one of two top-prize winners for Friday's Cash Five drawing," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "In addition to those two, there were 53,442 other winners who collected more than $155,000 in cash prizes." "My wife and I are going to use the money to put a down payment on a house," Gasca said. "We've wanted a bigger house."
