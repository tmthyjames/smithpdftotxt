Lotto TexasTM Winner Plans To Open His Own Business

Armando Ibarra of Mission already has plans for the check he's holding - starting his own business.

(Austin, April 14) - Yesterday, Armando Ibarra of Mission began the road to living out his dream - starting his own business. Ibarra matched the first five numbers for the Saturday, April 10 Lotto TexasTM drawing, and collected $15,858, before taxes, at the Texas Lottery® Harlingen Claim Center. His ticket was one of two that matched the first five numbers for the drawing. "He's always wanted to open his own business; either an auto sales place or body shop," said Karim Ibarra, speaking for his father. "He's a mechanic by trade. He always plays Lotto Texas and Cash Five." Ibarra purchased his winning ticket at United Drive Inn, located at 111 E. Griffen Parkway in Mission. The numbers drawn for Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot were: 15 - 7 - 11 - 40 - 16 and the Bonus Ball number was 43. "It's such an exciting thing to hear how our players plan to use their winnings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It's especially gratifying to hear how we're a part of a dream come true, so to speak. Congratulations to Mr. Ibarra, and good luck to him on his new venture." "He picked those numbers out of the blue," said Karim. "He went to check his numbers at the store, and that's when he found out he was holding a winning ticket. He asked me to take off work and drive him here to the claim center." Friday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimated $13 million, and Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $26 million.
