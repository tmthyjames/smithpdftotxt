Total Texas Lottery Sales Continue To Stay Above Last Year's Sales
(Austin, April 12) - Total sales of all Texas Lottery® products continue to track at more than five percent over the same period last year, Texas Lottery Commissioners were told today during the regular monthly meeting of the commission. "I'm very pleased with our continued strong showing in sales," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I've seen several news reports recently that claim our sales are down, and I'd like to say that this is untrue. The numbers say it all. Our general mix of games has kept our players interested and our sales at a significantly higher pace than last year." Total Fiscal Year 04 sales to day are $2.037 billion. This is up 5.3 percent from the same period in Fiscal Year 03 when sales were $1.926 billion. Fiscal Year 04 weekly sales average $63.4, also 5.3 percent above Fiscal Year 03 sales average of $60.2 million. Sales of Lotto TexasTM in Fiscal Year 03 were $526.3 million. The Lotto Texas game ranked third among all six-of-six instate Lottery games behind California and Florida during the last fiscal year. "I'm also comfortable with the performance of our flagship game, Lotto TexasTM," Greer said. "We keep tabs on sales at lotteries across the country, and it's clear that Lotto Texas sales surpass similar flagship games in numerous other states. "It's important to remember that our players through their buying patterns tell us what they think about our games," Greer said. "After only four months, our research shows that our players think of Mega MillionsTM as the triple-digit jackpot game, which means they play more when the game is in the high double digits and above. They've also told us how much they enjoy playing our current mix of instant games, which have created sales of more than $1.3 billion so far this fiscal year. Without a doubt, we are on track to generate sales of more than $3.4 billion this fiscal year." The jackpot for Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM game is an estimated $10 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $26 million.
