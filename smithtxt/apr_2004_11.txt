Winner's Home In Paradise Gets A Facelift, Thanks To $75,000 Texas Lottery Prize
(Austin, April 8) - Leslie Keith will finish remodeling his home in Paradise, Texas, near Fort Worth, now that he won the top prize of $75,000 playing Dominoes, a scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. "I went numb when the clerk checked the ticket," Keith said. "The first thing I'm going to do is finish remodeling the house." "We're delighted that Leslie plans to use his prize money to complete his 'dream' house," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "This is a good example of the big prize money you can win with our instant ticket games." Keith bought his ticket at the Pronto Food Mart, 6673 FM 2123 in Paradise. The $75,000 prize amount is before the required federal tax of 25 percent is taken out. Keith says his win has given him a new 'favorite' game. "It used to be Jumbo Bucks because I've won money playing it, but now it's Dominoes, of course," he laughed.
