Doubler Bingo Winner Will Use Prize For New Truck, Vacation
(Austin, April 5) - Darrell Hayes of Lubbock bought a Doubler Bingo, a Texas Lottery® instant ticket, and became the happy recipient of the $25,000 top prize of the game. He bought his ticket on March 29 and collected several days later at the Lottery's Lubbock Claim Center. "I stared at my ticket for two days," the new winner said. "I'm going to buy a new truck and take a vacation." "That kind of prize can buy plenty of 'truck' and some good vacation fun," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I hope Mr. Hayes gets every penny's worth of fun out of his Doubler Bingo prize." Hayes purchased the ticket at the Diamond Shamrock #1456, 6425 19th Street in Lubbock. The $25,000 prize he claimed is before taxes. This is not the first time Hayes has won a prize, he said. "I play regularly, and I've won from $2 to $30 before." Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $90 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM is worth an estimated $21 million.
