Texas Lottery Ranks In Top 10 Of Worldwide Lotteries For Total Sales In 2003
(Austin, April 1) - The Texas Lottery® ranks in the top 10 of worldwide lotteries in terms of total sales for the calendar year 2003, according to La Fleur's Magazine, which annually calculates sales of all lotteries around the world. In the March/April edition, the magazine cited Texas Lottery sales for the calendar year at $3.17 billion. "It's interesting to see and evaluate how our lottery compares with others within the United States, and internationally," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "When you take into consideration all the different types of games, diversity of population and cultures, it's an incredible feeling to see the Texas Lottery up there with other successful gaming institutions." The magazine's listing of the top 25 rankings among worldwide lotteries excluded any additional revenue generated by Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs). Two other North American lotteries were also listed among the top ranking: New York and Massachusetts. The Texas Lottery is currently ranked third in the United States in overall total sales behind New York and Massachusetts. "With the addition of Mega Millions to our lottery games mix, and with the upcoming installation of Self-Service Terminals, we are expecting to reach total sales of $3.4 billion for 2004," said Greer. "All of this, of course, translates into more revenue for Texas and the Foundation School Fund." La Fleur's list of the top 10 lotteries worldwide is as follows:
