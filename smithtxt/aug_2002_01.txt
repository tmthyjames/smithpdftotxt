Pasadena Lotto TexasTM Winner Collects Prize
(Austin, August 28) - The Texas Lottery Commission today issued a ceremonial check in the amount of $640,000 to the Varela Treviño Partnership of Pasadena, the first of 25 payments for winning the $16 million Lotto Texas(tm) jackpot drawing on August 10. Timoteo Varela is the general partner. The Pasadena-area welder said he has been playing Lotto since the game began in 1992. He chose the numbers himself. "I went to the store early Sunday morning for groceries, picked up a printout of the winning numbers and went home," Varela said. "While I was in the truck, I glanced at the printout and noticed I had three of the numbers, but didn't really look at them until I got home. "I woke my wife to tell her we'd won, but she kept telling me to go away because she was asleep," Varela said. "Finally, I got her to pay attention, and, like me, she didn't believe what she was seeing on the ticket." The rest of Varela's Sunday remains a blur. He said his children noticed that he couldn't seem to complete any chore he started. "I walked around the back yard a lot, looking at the ticket, and I couldn't do any thing around the house," Varela said. "My kids kept staring at me as I walked around with the ticket in my hand all day." Varela says he's not sure what comes next for him. "I haven't made any plans yet because I wanted to make sure I'd receive the prize before I got ahead of myself," he said. "What I do know is that this money will pay for the college education of my children." Mary Food Store, 3216 Pasadena Boulevard in Pasadena, sold the winning ticket. The store is eligible to receive a one percent bonus of the advertised jackpot for selling the jackpot winner. The bonus is $160,000. The winning ticket's numbers were 35 - 51 - 44 - 42 - 25 - 46. The winner requested minimum publicity. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $15 million. ....
