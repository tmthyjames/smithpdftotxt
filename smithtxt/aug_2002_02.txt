(Austin, August 28) - For an Austin retailer, selling one of the tickets that won the $70 million Lotto TexasTM jackpot means that both the store and its employees get a bonus. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud today presented a ceremonial retailer check of $100,000 to Mark Smith, zone manager of Valero Energy Corporation's Diamond Shamrock Corner Store, as a bonus for selling one of five jackpot winning tickets for the $70 million Lotto Texas drawing on June 22. Smith's sales zone includes Travis and Williamson counties. The Corner Store, located at 933 E. Rundberg Lane, received one fifth of the $500,000 retailer bonus. The company has already paid each of the store employees an equal portion of 10 percent of the retailer bonus. "I'm very pleased to present this bonus check of $100,000 to Mr. Smith," Cloud said. "Giving away a jackpot bonus is how we tell our retailers how much we appreciate them and all they do to keep the 'Games of Texas' fun and exciting for our players. The $70 million jackpot on June 22 caused lots of excitement around the state, and I'm happy to continue the excitement by giving this store a well-deserved check. Congratulations to you and all your employees for a job well done." The Corner Store sold the winning ticket to Shawn Pitts of Austin, who won $8,502,425, the Cash Value Option amount of his share of the $70 million jackpot. "As the largest retailer of lottery tickets in the state of Texas, I am happy to receive this check on behalf of Valero Energy Corporation's retail stores from the Texas Lottery Commission," said Smith. "This bonus means a lot to our store employees who will continue to provide our customers with fast, efficient service," he added. The Texas Lottery pays a bonus to any Lotto retailer who sells a 6-of-6 jackpot winning ticket, in accordance with Lottery procedures. The retailer bonus equals one percent of the jackpot won by the customer, not to exceed $500,000 per drawing.
