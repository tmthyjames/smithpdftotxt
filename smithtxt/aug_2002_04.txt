Bingo Advisory Committee And TLC To Address Needs Of Industry During Day-Long Meeting
(Austin, August 20) - Texas Lottery Commission Chairman Tom Clowe today recommended that the three-member Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) meet in joint session with the Bingo Advisory Committee (BAC) to discuss the needs of the Charitable Bingo industry in Texas. "We're seeing a continuing decline in gross receipts, charitable distributions and attendance at charitable bingo events, and it's incumbent on all of us to take a closer look at the reasons why this is happening," Clowe said. "I believe the place to start is by having the designated representatives of each group concerned with some aspect of conducting bingo and the Lottery Commission to delve deeply into the issue and set a course to better serve the needs of all involved." Billy Atkins, director of the Charitable Bingo Division at the Texas Lottery Commission, presented the quarterly report on 2002 second quarter gross receipts, charitable contributions, prizes awarded and attendance. "I'm sure members of the BAC will eagerly welcome the chance to meet with Lottery Commissioners," Atkins said. Clowe made his remarks at the monthly meeting of the three-member Texas Lottery Commission. No date for the joint meeting has been set. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
