New Cash FiveTM Game Produces First Bryan Winner

Minnie Sanders, Bryan's first Cash Five winner.

(Austin, August 20) - The Texas Lottery's newest game - Cash Five - has taken just three weeks to produce the first top-prize winner from Bryan. Minnie Sanders collected $20,865, her share of the cash prize from the Saturday, August 17, drawing. Her ticket was one of two that matched all five numbers for the top 5-of-5 prize of $41,730. "I was on the phone with my daughter when I found out," Sanders said. "I just sat there for a moment, and then I started hollering, 'I've won.' " Sanders purchased her winning ticket at Cash Food Market, located at 200 W. Martin Luther King Jr., in Bryan. The other ticket was sold in Keller at Exxon #60451, at 1975 E. Price Street. Both retailers are eligible to split a bonus of one-percent of the top prize. In this case, each retailer will receive $208.65 each. The numbers drawn were: 18 - 01 - 16 - 14 - 09. Sanders has become an old hand at winning the popular lottery game. Before changes were made to the previous Cash 5 game, she had collected $945 and $823 for matching 4-of-5 numbers in past drawings. "I'm putting most of this in the bank," she told lottery officials. "I'll pay a few bills, have a little fun time for myself, and share the rest with my family." The new Cash Five game is drawn Monday through Saturday at 10:12 p.m. Players choose five numbers from 1 to 37, and can win a guaranteed $2 cash prize for matching only two numbers. The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 8. The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $9 million. ....
