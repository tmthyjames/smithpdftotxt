Humberto Alvarez, winner of the $62,519 Cash Five prize.

(Austin, August 9) - A very excited Cash Five player showed up at the Texas Lottery's Dallas Claim Center today. Humberto Alvarez was the sole top-prize winner in last night's new Cash Five drawing, which paid out $62,519 before taxes were withheld. "I'm so very happy," Alvarez told lottery officials. "I've never won this much before. I really like this game better than the old one. Maybe I'll hit it again." Tickets for the new Cash Five game went on sale Sunday, July 28. Enhancements for the new game from the previous Cash 5 game included better odds, from 1 in 100 to 1 in 8, for players to win, and a guaranteed $2 cash prize for matching only two numbers. The new game is projected to produce approximately 50,000 to 60,000 winners per drawing, while the old game produced 5,000 to 6,000 winners per drawing. Alvarez was one of 67,741 winners for the Cash Five drawing held on Thursday, August 8. Alvarez purchased his winning ticket at Pioneer Grocery, located at 1102 E. Pioneer in Irving. For selling the prize-winning ticket, the retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $625.19. The numbers drawn were: 01 - 24 - 18 - 06 - 27. "I always buy my tickets in the same store," Alvarez said. "I've been playing there a long time." Alvarez makes the 8th top-prize winner in the Texas Lottery's newest game, Cash Five. Top-prize winners have won a combined total of $280,820 since the drawings started on Monday, July 29. To play Cash Five, players choose five numbers from 1 to 37. The drawings are held Monday through Saturday at 10:12 p.m. Players can win cash prizes for matching two, three, four or five numbers. "I think I'm going to buy a truck or car with my money," Alvarez explained. "Do a little shopping and fix my house too."
