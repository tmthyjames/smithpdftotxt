(Austin, August 9) - Mohammed Hossain, store manager of Housco Tech Inc. in Pearland, had to interrupt his boss' vacation for a very special reason. While owner Young Oh was in Korea watching the World Cup soccer games being battled out, his store sold one of the five jackpot-winning Lotto Texas tickets for the June 22 drawing, worth $70 million. "It took me a while to find him," said Hossain. "He was very excited about it when I told him though. We were all excited. It was the first time the store had sold a big winning ticket." The Lotto jackpot, which actually paid out more than $74 million to five winners, was the third highest payout in Texas Lottery history. The retail outlets that sold the five winning tickets divided the retailer bonus amount and will receive $100,000 each. Today, the Texas Lottery was on-hand to present Housco Tech Inc., with the $100,000 retailer bonus during a ceremonial check presentation. The Pearland retailer is the first of the five retailers to receive the bonus. "Mr. Oh gave all of us a bonus," said Hossain. "And he is giving away free Bar-B-Que to customers who come into the store on Saturday, August 10 as part of our celebration." The winner, James Quinton of Pearland, collected his share of the jackpot prize on Tuesday, July 2. His ticket was purchased the day of the drawing, and was the only ticket out of the five winners in which the numbers were self-chosen. The numbers drawn were: 16-11-02-13-34-26. "Our terminal was down the Friday before the drawing," said Hossain. "Our sales rep showed up Saturday with a different one and replaced it. That's the one that sold the winning ticket. We didn't even want to get rid of it when the new terminals came in this past month. It was a lucky machine."
