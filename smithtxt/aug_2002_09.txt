Quick Decision Turns Houston Resident Into Instant Lotto Texas Millionaire
(Austin, August 1) - An unwanted Lotto Texas ticket left behind at a retailer is bought by someone else. The player who decided to buy the five sets of numbers ends up matching all six numbers for the drawing. Sound amazing? It happened for one Houston resident for the Lotto Texas drawing held on Wednesday, July 17, when the jackpot was worth an estimated $4 million. Today, the Texas Lottery Commission presented RS Trust of Houston a ceremonial check in the amount of $160,000, the first of 25 installments for the 6-of-6 matching ticket. The trust will receive the same amount every July 15, for the next 24 years. The numbers drawn were: 46-11-21-26-40-32. The Lotto Texas winner purchased the Quick Pick ticket at Stop N Go #2392, located at 5838 Westheimer Road in Houston. The retail owner is eligible for a bonus of one-percent of the jackpot amount - $40,000. This makes the 7th Lotto Texas winner from the Houston area from January 1 through July 31 this year. Together, the winners have won more than $51 million. The Texas Lottery has paid out $690,000 in retailer bonuses for selling those jackpot-winning tickets. A representative of RS Trust has requested minimum publicity. The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is $9 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
