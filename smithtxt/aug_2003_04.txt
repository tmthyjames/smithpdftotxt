Three Looks Isn't All It Takes To Convince Midland Lottery Winner He's Hit A Sure Thing

Justin Williamson of Midland is all smiles while collecting his $250,000 prize from the Texas Lottery's 10 Times the Money scratch-off game.

(Austin, August 26) - Justin Williamson says he wasn't too sure that his ticket was a winner. After looking at it again and again...and again, he still took it to one of the clerks at Sundown Market to confirm it was a winner. The Texas Lottery® terminal came back with "Must claim at Texas Lottery Claim Center." His scratch-off ticket - 10 Times the Money - ended up a top-prize one, and today he claimed $250,000 at the Texas Lottery Odessa Claim Center. "I still can't believe it. As soon as I get the check I will," Williamson said. "I'm going to the bank and maybe buy a new threequarter ton Chevy extended cab pickup." The 21-year-old Midland resident says he mainly likes to play the Texas Lottery scratch-off games, and only plays 10 Times the Money when he has some extra cash in his pocket. "The clerk talked me into it," he explained. "I'm glad she did." Williamson bought his ticket at Sundown Market, located at 703 East Front Street in Midland. He also works at the retail location as a meat cutter.
