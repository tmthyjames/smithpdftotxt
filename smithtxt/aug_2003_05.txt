Austin Winner Says Texas Two Step® Moves To Top Of The List Of Favorite Texas Lottery® Games

Marvin Joiner of Austin starts his week by collecting $200,000 Texas Two Step jackpot from Friday's drawing.

(Austin, August 25) - Marvin Joiner of Austin says he likes to play all the Texas Lottery® games. Now he says he's of the mind to claim Texas Two Step® as his favorite, since he won Friday night's $200,000 jackpot. "I always thought it seemed like an easy game to play and win," Joiner said. "I'm on my way to be bill free, pay off a couple of cars and my house." Joiner purchased his jackpot winning Texas Two Step ticket at Speedy Stop #218, located at 2225 East Oltorf Street in Austin. The numbers drawn were: 11 - 28 - 24 - 31, and the Bonus Ball number was 21. "I looked up the numbers that night on the lottery's Web site, like I normally do," Joiner said. "I couldn't believe it, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. I still did everything like I usually do over the weekend though, including going to work." Joiner makes the sixth Austinite to win a Texas Two Step jackpot prize. "It sounds like a great way to start the weekend knowing you just won $200,000, and a great way to start the week by collecting it," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "The retail owner, Speedy Stop Food Stores, Incorporated, not only is eligible to receive a $2,000 bonus for selling Friday's jackpot winning ticket, they also sold the winning ticket for the August 19th drawing worth $550,000, giving them a total of $7,500 in retailer bonuses in one week." The $550,000 Texas Two Step jackpot winning ticket was sold in Laredo at Speedy Stop #37, located at 9101 McPherson.
