Three Tickets, Three Prizes For Austin Cash Five® Player

Ed Dantzer of Austin bought three Cash Five® tickets for Thursday night's drawing and won prizes in three categories.

(Austin, August 22) - Ed Dantzer of Austin bought three Cash Five® tickets for Thursday night's drawing, playing birthdays of his two sons, his grandson and himself. He won the top prize of $11,705 for matching five numbers, another $115 for matching four numbers, and $9 for matching only three numbers. "This means three times the fun for Mr. Dantzer and his Cash Five tickets," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "This is a rare occurrence for a winner in a single drawing. We've searched our game files for a twin occurrence and the closest thing we found was where players won in two prize categories in the same drawing. This may prove to be a first for us." The winning numbers were 28-29-6-12-9. Dantzer said he thought something was wrong with the ticket when he saw his numbers in the Austin American-Statesman. "You know, it is pure disbelief when this kind of thing happens," he said. "I read those numbers and immediately thought that it couldn't be, that there had to be something wrong somewhere and that it was probably with my ticket. I finally realized what had happened, but it took me a while." The Pennsylvania native said this unusual win isn't so unusual for him. "In the first three weeks of the Pennsylvania Lottery, I played the numbers of my home address and won each time because different combinations of 933 were drawn," he said. "The way this win happened is a little strange, too." Dantzer will use his winnings to visit Pennsylvania next month for his father's 90th birthday. "Every year, I go to Tahoe with a group of friends at Super Bowl time," he said. "This prize will make that trip a lot more fun
