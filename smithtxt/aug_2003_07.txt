Laredo's Mcpherson Road "Lucky Lane" For Two Texas Two-Step Players
(Austin, August 20) - There were two winners in the same game for the same drawing in the same city. The stores that sold the tickets are on the same street. The game is Texas Two Step® and the city is Laredo. "Lucky Lane" is McPherson Road and the winners are still unknown. One ticket purchased at Speedy Stop # 7, located at 9101 McPherson Road, matched all four numbers and the Bonus Ball to win the $550,000 jackpot in Tuesday night's drawing. The winning numbers were 6--9--15--24 and the Bonus Ball, 26. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $5,500 for selling the top-prize-winning ticket. The second ticket matched four numbers for a $938 prize. That ticket was bought at the Big Diamond #1016 at 5220 McPherson. "$550,000 is big money," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "By close of business today, neither claimant has shown up at our Laredo Claim Center." "We'll 'leave the light on' for them," said Greer. "Like with all tickets for our on-line games, players have 180 days from the drawing to claim the prize." Prizes up to $999,999 can be claimed at any one of the 21 Texas Lottery Claim Centers. The Laredo Claim Center is located at 1202 Del Mar Boulevard, Suite 4.
