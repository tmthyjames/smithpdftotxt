Texas Lottery® Winner Claims "Shamrock" Always Brings Him Luck

Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer presents Carlos Ambriz, Jr., the top cash-prize for Weekly Grand scratch-off game.

(Austin, August 15) - According to Carlos Ambriz, Jr., of Cameron, he has quite a bit of luck when he purchases his Texas Lottery® instant tickets at Diamond Shamrock stores. That routine paid off for him, since today, he collected more than $1 million, before taxes, at lottery headquarters in Austin - his prize for winning on the Weekly Grand scratch-off game. "I always buy my gasoline at Texaco and my tickets at Diamond Shamrock stores," Ambriz explained. "I just find that I seem to have much better luck when I've bought them at Diamond Shamrock stores." He purchased this top-prize winning ticket at One Stop Grocery, located at Highway 79 and North Main in Thorndale. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the winning scratch-off game. "I bought three tickets when I stopped on Saturday, August 9, and I scratched them the next morning at home," Ambriz said. "When I saw I had won, I put the ticket in our Bible, and later put it in a safety deposit box. I haven't eaten much since then either. I think I'm nervous." "We're certainly happy that Mr. Ambriz came in so quickly to get his prize. I hope the first thing he does with a little of his winnings is go buy himself, and his wife, a nice dinner to celebrate," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's great to hear how many players, like Mr. Ambriz, really love the Weekly Grand instant game. It's been one of the Texas Lottery's most popular games for eight years now, and has produced 61 top-prize winners," he added. The Weekly Grand scratch-off has been issued a total of 11 times since its launch in 1995. Players have the chance to win $1,000 a week for 20 years, for a grand prize total of $1,040,000. Players must be 18 years or older to play this or any other Texas Lottery game.
