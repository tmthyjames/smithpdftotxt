Back-To-Back Winners Claim $1,000,000 In "Classic" Game From Texas Lottery®
(Austin, August 12) - For the second day in a row, someone came to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin with a ticket for the top cash-prize in the $1,000,000 Classic scratch-off game. "We had a new millionaire in yesterday from Normangee and today, it's great to congratulate our latest winner from Victoria," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Lillian Louise Threadgill is the sixth winner of this very popular game. There are eight one-million-dollar prizes in this game, so I get to look forward to meeting two more new millionaires." Threadgill purchased her ticket at The 'Other' Store #1 in Victoria. The retail store owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. The store is located at 2407 Port Lavaca Highway. The $1,000,000 Classic scratch-off game was introduced in April. Players can instantly win cash prizes of $1,000,000, $5,000, $500, $350, $200, $100, $70, $40, and $20. The cost of the ticket is $20. The first one-million-dollar prize was claimed May 6 by a woman from Pasadena. Since then, winners have come in from Newton, San Antonio, Webster, and yesterday, Normangee.
