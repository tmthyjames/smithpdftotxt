$1,000,000 Classic Winner Backtracks To Store - Couldn't Remember Locking Up For The Night

Carol and Gene Davis, with Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer, hold her $1,000,000 ceremonial check.

(Austin, August 11) - Carol Davis of Normangee got so excited about winning the top cash-prize with the Texas Lottery® $1,000,000 Classic instant ticket, she got all the way home and couldn't remember if she had locked up the store doors at Biddle's Mobil where she had worked for five years. "I just had a feeling about that ticket," Davis said. "I scratched it before leaving for the night, and it took a little while for me to realize what I was seeing. I went home to look at it under a magnifying glass, and then couldn't remember if I had locked up the store." Davis asked her husband to make sure she was holding one of the $1,000,000 winning tickets. "She said, 'I have something I need you to look at, and I need you to take me back to the store,' " Gene said. "When I saw the ticket, I told her, 'Yes ma'am, I believe it is (a winning ticket).' " The retail storeowner of Biddle's Mobil is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. The store is located at 3rd and Main in Normangee. "Carol makes the fifth winner with the Texas Lottery $1,000,000 Classic instant game," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's been a tremendous pleasure meeting each and every one of them, and there are still three more $1,000,000 cash prizes to win instantly." According to Davis, she and her husband have not made any big plans yet. "We might try to go through the Amish country some time though," Davis said.
