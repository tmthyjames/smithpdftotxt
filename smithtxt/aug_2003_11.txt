Last Lotto TexasTM Five-Of-Six Winner Collects $21,318 Prize From July 30 Drawing

Randy Miller of Arlington, winner of a Lotto Texas ticket worth $21,318.

(Austin, August 11) - Randy Miller of Arlington keeps his Texas Lottery® tickets in his wallet. That way, they're easy to spot and when he's in a retail location and pulls a bill out of his wallet, he can get someone to check them for him. That routine brought a nice result on his recent trip to Houston to visit friends. He discovered that he had been carrying around a Lotto TexasTM ticket worth $21,318. His was one of four tickets that matched five numbers but not the Bonus Ball for the $47 million drawing on July 30. "My first reaction was total surprise, and I'm still pretty surprised," Miller explained. Miller bought the ticket at the 7-11 store on 2300 Green Oak Boulevard in Arlington. He claimed his prize at the Lottery's Houston Claim Center this past Friday. If you think the ticket was well-traveled, consider the first phone call Miller made. The Fort Worth Brewery employee said the first person he called was his brother, who is in Nicaragua on business, to surprise him with news of the win. Miller said he's been playing Lotto Texas since it started and intends to keep playing. "After all," he noted, "I only missed the bonus ball number." Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, said all four 5-of-6 tickets for that drawing have now been claimed.

"Our Houston Claim Center has been busy with winners from this drawing," said Greer. "Two of the 5-of-6 tickets were sold in Houston, and we heard from those winners almost immediately. Now, Mr. Miller has claimed his prize there as well. The 5-of-6 ticket sold in Waco has already been claimed so now the question is, 'Where's the jackpot winner?' " Greer said one ticket sold in Eagle Lake matched all 5 numbers and the Bonus Ball for the $47 million jackpot. He went on to explain that someone claiming to have the winning ticket has contacted the Lottery Commission and passed the initial inquiry, the first stage of claiming the jackpot prize. The claimant has 180 days from the drawing to present the ticket at Lottery headquarters in Austin and complete the validation process. The $47 million jackpot on July 30th is the largest since the Lotto Texas game was re-vamped to generate higher jackpots. On the day of the drawing, Texas claimed the largest jackpot in the country, beating out both Mega Millions and Powerball. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million.
