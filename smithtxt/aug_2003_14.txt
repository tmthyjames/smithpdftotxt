Humble Lottery Retailer Receives Bonus - Sold First Jackpot Ticket For New Lotto TexasTM Game
(Austin, August 6) - The Texas Star Shop in Humble holds an extraordinary place in Texas Lottery® history. The lottery retailer sold the first jackpot winning ticket for the new Lotto TexasTM game for the drawing held on June 7. Today, in a special ceremony with Executive Director Reagan E. Greer, the store was awarded a ceremonial check in the amount of $370,000 - one percent of the jackpot amount, $37 million. "It wasn't so long ago that I had the opportunity to meet the winner that bought his winning ticket here at Texas Star Shop," said Greer. "I'm happy to finally get the chance to present this ceremonial check to the store that sold it, and congratulate those that are such an integral part of the success of the Texas Lottery and its games." The winner, David Kelly of Houston, claimed his prize on June 9. He chose the Cash Value Option, and received more than $24.2 million, before taxes. Kelly was the first jackpot winner for the new Lotto Texas game, which features a bonus ball-style play. Sales for the new game began on May 4 and the first drawing was held on May 7. "Since the start of the new Lotto Texas game, we're averaging 89,482 winning tickets per drawing," Greer explained. "And, leading up to last week's $47 million jackpot, we had a total of 1.3 million winning tickets overall. That's 166,325 more than the $53 million jackpot in January." The number of average winning tickets per drawing is based on 25 draws. The jackpot for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing is worth an estimated $5 million.
