Floresville Weekly Grand Winner Heads Into Retirement Sunset With A Load Of Cash

"What better retirement send-off can you get than a bundle of cash?" asked TLC Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. Standing besides the ceremonial check for $1,040,000 are David Jenkins and Reagan E. Greer.

(Austin, August 1) - David Jenkins of Floresville had already planned to retire from his job at City Public Service (CPS) of San Antonio after more than 33 years on the job. But he spent his first official day of retirement today in a very unexpected way. He came to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin to claim the top prize in the Weekly Grand Scratch-off game: $1,000 per week for 20 years. "What better retirement send-off can you get than a bundle of cash?" asked Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We'll be sending Mr. Jenkins a check for $1,000 per week for 20 years. That's $1,040,000, before taxes." At today's ceremonial check presentation, Jenkins recalled that when he stopped for barbecue at Lone Oak Grocery, he got a side of two Weekly Grand tickets. "The clerk gave me two of the older Weekly Grand tickets, and I wanted some from the new game," said Jenkins. "But I learned a long time ago, don't turn it back. "As I ate my lunch, I scratched the tickets and when I saw that 'GRAND' word, well, I almost fainted." Jenkins quickly called his wife, Sally, who, naturally, was skeptical. "She kept asking me, 'Are you sure?' " he said. Jenkins said he hasn't any big plans for the money, except maybe to visit Las Vegas and do some traveling with his family.
