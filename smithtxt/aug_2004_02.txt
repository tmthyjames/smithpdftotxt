Hold The Phone, Killeen Man Collects $25,000 On Instant MONOPOLYTM

James "Rosie" Rosenberry of Killeen won the top prize, $25,000, in the Instant MONOPOLY scratch off game.

(Austin, August 31) - James L. "Rosie" Rosenberry of Killeen didn't bother to check the $2 Instant MONOPOLYTM ticket he purchased last Wednesday until after he got home. While on the phone, though, he finally scratched off the numbers and realized he'd won the top prize ­ $25,000! "At first, I didn't even notice the amount," said Rosenberry. "But then I took a second look and I almost dropped the phone." Rosenberry said he's a semi-regular player of the $2 and $5 Texas Lottery® scratch off games, and has previously won as much as $100. He said he'll use the money to pay off some bills, and, if they're nice to him, he might even spring for some doughnuts for his coworkers. "I never knew I had so many friends at work," joked Rosenberry. "But, it's like I told them, 'you can't win if you don't play!'" "Millions of Texans enjoy playing and winning all of the Games of Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Instant MONOPOLY is one of the newer additions to our scratch off line-up, but it's already one of the most popular." Rosenberry purchased his winning Instant MONOPOLY ticket at Bestway Food Store located at 907 N. Gray St. in Killeen. Instant MONOPOLY offers prizes in the following amounts: $25,000, $2,500, $1,000, $200, $100, $50, $25, $15, $10, $8, $5, $3 and $2. The odds of winning any prize are one in 4.65, including break-even prizes. In addition, the Texas Lottery will
