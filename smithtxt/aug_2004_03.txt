Play-Big, Win-Big Philosophy Brings $1 Million To San Antonio Man Playing Run The Table
(Austin, August 31) - Thuong Van Tran firmly believes that you have to play big to win big. It's the thing that got him interested in the first-ever $25 ticket from the Texas Lottery. "That's why I bought a $25-ticket," he said. "People are afraid to play big, but not me. You have to spend some money to win big, and I won $1 million." "All it takes to win, and win big, too, is one ticket," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Mr. Tran's philosophy got him where he knew it would, into the winner's circle. Run The Table is our first $25 ticket, and Mr. Tran is our second winner in this history-making game for us." Tran bought the ticket at the Lotto Food Store, located at 4401 Rittiman Road in San Antonio. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold a top prize winner in this game. Tran says he plans to use his winnings to pay off his bills and make some investments. Run The Table also offers an opportunity to win prizes of $20,000, $10,000, $2,000, $1,000, $500, $200, $100, $50, $40, $30 and $25. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 2.78. Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimated $18 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $31 million.
