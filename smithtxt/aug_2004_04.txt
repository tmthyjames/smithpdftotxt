Boerne Woman Wins First Of Four Corvettes Up For Grabs With Texas Lottery's Corvette Cash

Velma Houy of Boerne, who won the top prize in Corvette Cash. "My daughter-in-law and my son didn't believe me when I called them to tell them I now had a 'Vette.'"

(Austin, August 30) - Velma Houy bought a Corvette Cash ticket on a whim while on break at work and won the top prize, a Corvette car, the first of the four convertibles that are offered in the game. "I was going on break while at work last week at the HEB Store in Boerne, and on the way out the door, I bought one $5-ticket from the vending machine," she said. "My daughter-in-law and my son didn't believe me when I called them to tell them I now had a 'Vette.'" Houy bought the ticket with five dollars that she won playing another game. In all the excitement over winning the Corvette, she forgot the name of the first game she played. "We've been waiting for our first winner of the top prize in this game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Since we issued Corvette Cash in June, we've already sold 71 percent of the game. So I'm telling our players, make sure you scratch your Corvette Cash tickets if you've got some lying around on a coffee table or stuck in your wallet. There may be a Corvette convertible in your immediate future." Houy bought the ticket from an instant-ticket vending machine (ITVM) located in the HEB #232, located at 420 W. Bandera Road in Boerne. Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimated $18 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $31 million.
