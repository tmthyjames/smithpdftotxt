Ingleside Resident Wins Weekly Grand Top Prize
(Austin, August 23) - Emilio Rodriguez of Ingleside now has a 20-year plan, and it's called winning at Weekly Grand, a Texas Lottery® scratch game that has made him the 67th winner of the game's top prize. "Weekly Grand continues to be one of our most popular games," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Some players, like Mr. Rodriguez, are faithful to it and won't play any other scratch ticket. Now he's got $1,000 a week for the next 20 years." Rodriguez bought the ticket at the Fastop Food Store #1, located at 1901 John Stockbauer in Victoria. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling this top-prize-winning ticket. There is one top prize remaining in the current issue. The winner requested minimal publicity. Tomorrow's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimated $10 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $26 million.
