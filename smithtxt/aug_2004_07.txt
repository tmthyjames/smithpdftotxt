Pearland Woman Wins Big On Run The Table
(Austin, August 23) - Margaret Foisner of Pearland loves to play Texas Lottery® scratch off games and has won hundreds of dollars on several occasions, but she usually sticks with the $1 and $2 games. On August 4, however, she decided to invest $25 in a Run The Table ticket. That investment paid off right away when Foisner won the game's top prize: $1,000,000! "I actually didn't even notice at first, but then I took a second look and realized the prize amount," said Foisner. "I called my husband to let him know, but he didn't really believe it until I faxed him a copy." "Run The Table is the first $25 instant ticket that the Texas Lottery has ever offered players," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Our research told us that players would enjoy the better odds and high payouts, and winners like Mrs. Foisner have proved the research right." Foisner says she doesn't have any concrete plans for her winnings yet, but she'll definitely continue to buy Texas Lottery scratch off tickets. "Winning a big prize like this is great, but really, I just like to play," explained Foisner. Run The Table offers players the chance to win other cash prizes, including: $20,000, $10,000, $2,000, $1,000, $500, $200, $100, $50, $40, $30 and $25. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 2.78. Foisner purchased her winning Run The Table ticket from the Kwik Cash #1 located at 9715 Telephone Rd. in Houston.
