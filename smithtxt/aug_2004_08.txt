Friday 13th Purchase Pays Off For Dallas Mega MillionsTM Player
(Austin, August 23) - Fortunately, Michael A. Evans of Dallas is not a superstitious man. If he were, he might have had second thoughts about purchasing his Mega MillionsTM tickets on Friday the 13th. Instead, Evans, his wife and six of his coworkers were lucky winners by matching five of six numbers in the August 17 Mega Millions drawing. That was good for $175,000 before taxes. The group won an additional $2 by matching two of six numbers on another ticket for the same drawing. "We play all the games, all the time," said Evans. "We've won lots of times, but nothing like this before." After they divide the winnings, Evans says he's planning to buy a truck to pull his boat. He also plans to keep playing the Games of Texas. "So much for Friday the 13th being bad luck," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "This is just further proof that Texas Lottery players get lucky every day!" Mega Millions jackpots begin at $10 million and non-jackpot prizes range from $2 to $175,000. Evans purchased his winning tickets at the Grand Exxon Tiger Mart, located at 2075 Buckner Boulevard in Dallas. The next Mega Millions drawing will be held at 10:12 p.m. Tuesday night.
