Scratch-Off Technique Pays Off Big For Aspermont Weekly Grand Player

Phyllis Sunday of Aspermont was the 66th top prize winner of the Weekly Grand instant ticket game.

(Austin , August 18) - Phyllis Sunday of Aspermont is pretty set in her ways when it comes to checking her Texas Lottery® scratch off tickets. First she reveals the numbers to see if she's got a winner and only then does she check the prize amount. So Sunday was pretty sure she was at least going to get her money back on the Weekly Grand ticket she purchased on August 7, 2004, even before she uncovered her prize. "I figured I'd get my $2 back, maybe $10 if I was lucky and that would have been fine with me," said Sunday. "But when I saw that I'd won the grand prize, I just said 'Thank you Jesus.'" A shocked Sunday then took her ticket back into the store where she bought it to make sure her eyes weren't tricking her. The clerk confirmed that she did hold the winning ticket, worth $1,000 a week for the next 20 years. "No matter how you play the Games of Texas it's always fun to win, whether it's a dollar or a top-tier prize like the one Phyllis Sunday bought," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Weekly Grand has always been one of our more popular instant games since it debuted in 1995, and Phyllis is the 66th winner to take home the top prize." Sunday's going to use some of her winnings to buy some new eyeglasses and catch up on her bills.
