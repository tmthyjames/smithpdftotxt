Latin Lotto Scam Artists Rob Baytown Victim Of $1,100
(Austin, August 13) - A Baytown woman was robbed of $1,100 yesterday by two Latin American scam artists using a phony Texas Two Step® ticket they said won a prize of $325,000. "These con artists are at it again, now making a victim of a woman in Baytown," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "What this means is that the scam artists are still in the Houston area, so Houston residents should take extra care not to be taken in by these thieves, and especially not to believe these cons when they say they need money to claim a lottery prize. That simply isn't true." The woman was approached by a woman who claimed she was a Spaniard in the parking lot of a Home Depot store located on Garth Road in Baytown. While the con artist and the victim were speaking, a Hispanic mid-20s male became involved, also. He told the women that they needed $20,000 to collect the prize, which he said he and the first woman could not do because they did not have legal identification. Claiming he was an architect from Costa Rica, the male said he could come up with $16,000 and asked the victim for $4,000, which she said she did not have. The victim, who was on her way to pay a bill, agreed to give them $1,100 that she had with her. While the victim stepped away to make a phone call, the two con artists disappeared. The woman suspect who claimed to be a Spaniard was described as having blonde hair, mid-40s, and was elegantly dressed wearing light red pants and a pink blouse. The male has an olive complexion and was wearing gray pants and a white shirt. An investigation is underway by the Baytown Police Department.
