Fort Stockton Man Cashes In $175,000 Mega MillionsTM Ticket, Next Jackpot $35 Million

David M. Shelton of Fort Stockton won $175,000 in the August 10, 2004, Mega Millions drawing.

(Austin, August 12) - David M. Shelton of Fort Stockton had trouble sleeping Tuesday night, so he was still a little drowsy when he got up and went out to get the paper Wednesday morning. However, he got a real eye-opener when he checked the Mega MillionsTM drawing results and discovered he'd matched five of six numbers, good enough for $175,000 before taxes. "It was really kind of strange the way I tossed and turned all night," said Shelton, a regular Mega Millions player. "But I'll gladly trade a restless night for that kind of money." Shelton says he and his wife have no immediate plans for their winnings other than to keep playing Mega Millions and help their grandson further his education. "My grandson doesn't know it yet, but he's really the big winner," said Shelton. There were no tickets sold for Tuesday night's drawing in any of the 11 states that participate in Mega Millions that matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball. Across the state, Texas Mega Millions players, including Shelton, won a total of $441,850 in lower tier prizes. Friday night's jackpot will be worth an estimated $35 million. "We're excited for all of the winners in the last drawing, especially the Sheltons out in west Texas," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Texas joined the Mega Millions game last December and we're still waiting for our first jackpot winner. This Friday's $35 million jackpot could be the one!"
