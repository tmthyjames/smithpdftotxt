Dreamy Numbers Prove To Be A Dream-Come-True For Cash FiveTM Winner Of $33,393 From Waco

Don Peterson of Waco, winner of $33,393.

(Austin, August 11) - Two years ago, Don Peterson of Waco dreamt of four lottery numbers. Since then he's been playing those numbers along with one he added in Cash FiveTM, and they proved to be a dream come true. "On Sunday morning, I was reading the Waco Tribune-Herald, and I thought that there had to be a mistake, that the paper had misprinted the winning numbers for Cash Five because they were mine. I couldn't believe those same numbers that I dreamt and that I've been playing all this time were in the paper." "He's got a habit of looking at the numbers in the paper one by one," said Gail Peterson, his wife. "He puts his thumb over them and moves it over them slowly so each number appears one by one. He likes to sneak up on them." Home alone, he started yelling in excitement. "I was the only one that won the $33,393." "Mr. Peterson's win is a good example of following your dreams," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It's a mystery why numbers show up in dreams like they did in Mr. Peterson's, but it obviously was a profitable idea for our winner to pay attention to what his subconscious was saying." Peterson says he plans to do spend his winnings on necessities. "I'm going to fix my tooth and pay off some things," he said. "I enjoy woodworking, so I'll probably buy some more tools, too."
