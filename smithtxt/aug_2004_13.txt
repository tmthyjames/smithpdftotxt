July Was Hot For Texas Lottery® Players
(Austin, August 6) - Sales of Texas Lottery tickets were hot in July, producing a total of 22,626,142 winning tickets. That translates into a whopping $277,412,014 in prizes that were paid to players. "Our sales were really cooking last month, but that's not all," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The real news here is that our sales are more than 10 percent above the same time period last year, which bodes well for our total sales figures for this fiscal year that ends on the last day of this month." The largest Lotto TexasTM jackpot was $13 million posted on July 31. The top Mega MillionsTM jackpot, $290 million, occurred on July 2. Texas Two Step® had a top prize of $400,000, also on July 2.

"The big jackpots we've had this summer in Lotto Texas and Mega Millions pushed sales in all the other games," Greer said. "For example, we had the highest top prize, $47,943, in Cash Five that we've had this year the same night the Mega Millions jackpot was at $290 million, which proves once again that sales are driven by the size of our jackpots." June was the biggest-ever sales month for the Texas Lottery. Fueled by a record Lotto Texas jackpot of $145 million, sales totaled more than $391.6 million for the month.
