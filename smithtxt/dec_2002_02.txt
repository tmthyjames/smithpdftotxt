Grapevine Man Claims Christmas Eve Texas Two Step Jackpot
(Austin, December 27) - Tommy Rowland wasn't the first winner to show up at the Texas Lottery Commission's Austin headquarters today - but he was the biggest. The Grapevine man had the sole jackpot winning ticket for the Texas Two Steptm drawing held on Christmas Eve, December 24th. Rowland was out doing some last minute Christmas shopping Tuesday when he stopped by Hansom Hank's at 5351 William D Tate Avenue in Grapevine, and bought five quick picks. "I play Two Step and Lotto Texastm," Rowland explained. "I just tossed the tickets on the floor board of my truck and didn't think about it until I went into work on Thursday and checked my numbers on the web site. "I usually go through the numbers one at a time and see that I matched one, maybe two numbers," Rowland explained. "This was different from the start ... it was an amazing feeling when I saw that I had matched all the numbers." The numbers drawn were 3-7-12-24 and the Bonus Ball 19. Rowland's co-workers at Harvest States Foods heard his exclamations and came into his office. "I just won some money," he told them. The actual "sum" was $575,000. After taxes were deducted, Rowland took home a check for $419,750. The retailer, Hansom Hank's, is eligible to receive a bonus of $5,750 for selling the jackpot winning ticket. Rowland knows where part of his winnings will go. "I signed my daughter up for the Texas Tomorrow Fund when she was born, and I have her tuition at any state school paid for," he said. "Now I'm going to increase my payments, so she can go to a private school if she wants." Rowland has one more goal in mind ... he wants to be the first player to win Texas Two Step and Lotto Texas. "I'll be back," he told the Austin Claim Center staff, who had just finished processing two $1,000 prize winners. With a wink and a nod, he tucked his check into his bag and was on his way home, bearing a very special after Christmas gift for his family. Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is $200,000. ....
