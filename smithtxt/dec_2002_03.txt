Cash Five Christmas Drawing Jackpot Claimed By Cedar Hill Man

Eli Bryant of Cedar Hill smiles after winning a Cash Five jackpot of $34,167.

(Austin, December 27) - Eli Bryant of Cedar Hill outside Dallas won something special on Christmas Day: a Cash Fivetm jackpot of $34,167. He didn't know it, though. The 47-year-old electrician was at work reading the Dallas Morning News on the morning of the 26th when he saw his winning numbers for the December 25 Cash Five drawing lined up right before his eyes. "I was stunned, I couldn't believe what I was looking at right there in front of me, the same numbers on my one Quick Pick," he said. "I had to ask to get off work, so I could come get my money today, since the Lottery was closed yesterday." Bryant claimed his prize today at the Texas Lottery Claim Center in Dallas. He told Lottery officials he had to call his wife a few times before he finally found her to give her the news. "She's telling everybody she believed me when I told her, but I know she didn't," Bryant said. "When she saw the ticket, she knew then, though." Bryant says he plans to pay off some bills, tithe at his church and then spend some money on his wife. "We might do a little traveling, which my wife really wants to do," he said. "I may even buy a big-screen TV to watch the bowl games next week." Bryant says he's been playing Cash Five regularly every week for the last few years. "And I plan to keep playing, too," he said. "I've won small amounts before, but nothing like this. It's my favorite game. I already bought a ticket for tonight."
