Time Is Running Out To Claim Texas Two Step And Lotto Texas Jackpots
(Austin, December 18) - The Texas Lottery Commission is on a search for whoever is holding the Texas Two StepTM and Lotto TexasTM tickets purchased in the Dallas/Fort Worth area nearly six months ago. The two tickets are worth a combined total of $5,484,917. The Texas Two Step ticket, purchased for the June 25th drawing, is worth $300,000, and expires Sunday, December 22, at midnight. If that player doesn't "step" up soon, he or she will unwittingly become the first Texas Two Step player to pass up a jackpot prize. "We encourage any of our Texas Lottery players who were in the Grand Prairie area during that time to check their tickets," said Acting Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "They want to go look in their drawers at home, in the visors in the car, and under the cushions of their couches, that is, go to all those places where they think they may have put away the old tickets they purchased." Players have 180 days after the date of a drawing in which to claim a prize. "We want that ticket to be claimed by that player," Grief said. "We don't want that 180th day to come and go without that happening." The winning numbers drawn for the $300,000 prize are as follows: 10-35-16-06 and the Bonus Ball number was 23. The Texas Two Step ticket was purchased at Whip In #1001, located at 3502 S. Carrier in Grand Prairie. The retail owner received a bonus of $3,000 for selling the ticket. "We have people come from out of town in this area, particularly during the holidays and for summer vacations," said Whip In Manager, Rusty Young. "They may have a winner and miss it." To be a valid claim, the ticket must be presented during normal business hours at any of the Lottery's 22 claim centers or must be postmarked before Sunday, December 22. A claim form to submit with the ticket can be downloaded from the Texas Lottery Commission web site, www.txlottery.org (see below for a link to the claim form). A listing of claim center locations is also available on the web site. The outstanding Lotto Texas 6-of-6 ticket was purchased for the July 13th drawing, worth an estimated $9 million. The ticket was sold at the 7-Eleven store, located at 3329 Oak Lawn Avenue in Dallas. The winning numbers drawn were: 29-42-22-0811-05. The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, giving the winner a prize total of $5,184,917, before taxes. The 180-day deadline to claim this ticket is January 9, 2003. If the two jackpot prizes are not claimed by the 180-day deadlines, the prize money will be transferred to the Lottery's Unclaimed Prize Fund. The unclaimed prize money supports two medical accounts, the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account that benefits the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), and the Tertiary Care Facility Fund that helps hospitals around the state pay for indigent health care.
