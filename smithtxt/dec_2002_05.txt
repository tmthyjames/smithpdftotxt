Texas Lotterytm Hits 10-Billionth Dollar Milestone

Lottery proceeds to the State of Texas from May 1992 to December 2002 have equaled more than $10 billion ($10,050,631,425).

(Austin, December 13) - The Texas Lottery Commission marked another financial milestone today by delivering nearly $98.4 million to the State, pushing the total of monies the Texas Lotterytm raised during the last 10 years to more than $10 billion. The total generated by the Texas Lottery is $10,050,631,425. "Ten billion in 10 years, it's an enviable record, and one we could not have achieved without our players and retailers," said Acting Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Gary Grief. "Since the day tickets went on sale in May of 1992, the Texas Lottery has been doing the job it was created to do, generating revenue for the State. In the process, it has broken one sales record after another, making it one of the pre-eminent lotteries in the world and bringing much-needed dollars to state government, medical institutions and, most importantly, public education." When the Lottery first began, the money was deposited in the General Revenue Fund. In 1997, the Legislature dedicated lottery revenues to education, and since Fiscal Year 1998, money has been deposited in the Foundation School Fund. The Fund is administered by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). According to TEA, the Fund pays for teacher salaries, administration and educational resource costs, and helps school districts whittle down the debt they've incurred to build new facilities. Originally part of the Office of the Comptroller of Public Accounts, the Lottery got off the ground with $12 million in start-up funds stipulated in the legislation introduced to create a lottery, House Bill 54 by State Representative Ron Wilson, D-Houston. The Texas Lottery clocked one of the fastest-ever start-up times among North American lotteries, selling its first instant ticket 47 days ahead of schedule.
