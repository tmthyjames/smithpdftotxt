7-Eleven Store Manager Andy Taing shakes hands with Texas Lottery Online Products Specialist René McCoy. GTECH Lottery Sales Representative John Lewis looks on.

(Austin, December 13) - It seldom happens like this, but the store that sold a winning Lotto Texas jackpot ticket received its bonus before the ticket has been claimed. Texas Lottery Commission Marketing Specialist René McCoy presented a ceremonial retailer check of $90,000 today to Emile Samra of Southland Corporation/7-Eleven, which owns 7-Eleven #1611-12223. The Dallas retailer sold the $9 million Lotto Texas jackpot winner for the drawing on July 13. The store is located at 3329 Oak Lawn Avenue. The sole winning ticket sold remains outstanding and expires on Thursday, January 9, 2003. Players have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim a prize. "It's always a pleasure to visit a jackpot-selling retailer, and I'm very pleased to present this bonus check of $90,000 to Mr. Samra and the Southland Corporation," McCoy said. "Giving away a jackpot bonus is how we tell our retailers how much we appreciate them and all they do to keep the 'Games of Texas' fun and exciting for our players. The only thing that could make this more exciting is if the person with the winning ticket walked in right now." The Texas Lottery Commission pays a bonus to any Lotto Texas retailer who sells a 6-of-6 jackpot winning ticket. In accordance with Lottery procedures, the retailer bonus equals one percent of the jackpot won by the customer, not to exceed $500,000 per drawing. From January 1 through the end of November 2002, nine Dallas-Fort Worth-area retailers have sold a six-of-six Lotto Texas jackpot winner. The Texas Lottery Commission has paid a total of $1,040,000 in retailer bonuses to the outlets that sold those tickets.
