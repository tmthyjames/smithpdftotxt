(Austin, December 12) - Today, the Texas Lottery Commission's Houston Claim Center demonstrated it's not just a place for players to pick up their winnings. The area claim center hosted a ceremonial check presentation to lottery retailer Moussi Mourad for selling the $19 million jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket for the August 31 drawing. "I'm happy to present this ceremonial check for $190,000 to Mr. Mourad," said Robert Tirloni, Texas Lottery On-Line Product Manager. "With nearly 17,000 retailers who are the bridge between the Lottery and our players, 7 Days Food Store has really gone the extra mile to keep the customers happy and help us to maintain a high level of fun and entertainment in our Lottery games." The winner, Dudley Babin Jr., of Houston purchased his jackpot winning ticket at Mourad's store, located at 5203 Griggs Road in Houston. Babin chose the Cash Value Option and received $11,427,094. He chose his winning six-number combination by picking numbered Ping-Pong balls out of a bag. The numbers drawn were: 32 - 36 - 37 - 40 - 41 - 43. "I'm still trying to build up my business here, and this little extra helps a lot," said Mourad. "I'm going to pay off my store and I'm in the process to buy the property it's on." "A lot of people in the neighborhood come in and see that we sold a winning Lotto Texas ticket and say there's a chance they will win now. It's a wonderful thing to happen in the neighborhood," he added. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. ....
