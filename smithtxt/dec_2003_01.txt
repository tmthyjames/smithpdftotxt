Mega MillionsTM Leads Texas Lottery® Into Highest Sales Week Since January 2003
(Austin, December 31) - The holiday season was a great success for the Texas Lottery Commission, thanks in part to the state's joining Mega MillionsTM. From the start of game, December 3, to date, Mega Millions sales have totaled $30.7 million, and sales for all games in the same time period totaled more than $276.6 million. "We ended the week of December 27 with more than $72 million in weekly sales," said Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "That's the highest sales week the Texas Lottery has had since the week ending January 25, 2003. It's helped enormously that players are so enthusiastic over two of our games, Lotto Texas and Mega Millions, which have had such high jackpots." Fiscal year-to-date (September 1 to December 30) sales total $1,014,152,849. That's up 4.5 percent over same-period sales last year, which totaled $970,443,275. Last night's Mega Millions drawing produced one ticket that matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball. The ticket was sold in Ohio. In Texas, there were four tickets matching the first five numbers for the $175,000 cash prize. Of those tickets, one sold in Edinburg is worth $700,000 because the ticket holder also bought the MegaplierTM feature, found only in Texas. The Megaplier allows players a chance to double, triple or quadruple their non-grand/jackpot prizes. There were 107,628 other prizetier winners in Texas, and of those winning tickets, 25,580 were purchased with the Megaplier feature. "I wish that jackpot winner would have been Texas' first in the Mega Millions game," said Greer. "However, players have had good luck with the next prize tier, $175,000. To date, there have been 11 tickets that won that prize, and three of those were purchased with the Megaplier. It's been a tremendously exciting month for the Texas Lottery and our players." Since the first Mega Millions drawing on December 5, there have been 541,982 cash prize winning tickets in Texas. Of those, 142,228 were purchased with the Megaplier feature. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million. Friday's Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $10 million.
