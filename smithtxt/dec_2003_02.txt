Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM Jackpot Increases To $155 Million
(Austin, December 29) - Today, the 11-member group of Mega MillionsTM announced Tuesday's jackpot would be worth an estimated $155 million, up $5 million from the previous estimated amount. No ticket matched all five numbers plus the Mega Ball for Friday's drawing worth $125 million. "Overall sales within the entire group prompted this morning's actions," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "Bumping up the jackpot amount always creates excitement for players, and we expect this bump will do just that." There were two tickets sold in Texas that matched five numbers in Friday's drawing. One ticket, sold in McAllen, was purchased with the MegaplierTM feature and is actually worth $350,000. The other ticket was sold in El Paso. The numbers drawn were: 29 - 20 - 10 - 17 - 1 and the Mega Ball number was 36. There have been seven tickets sold in Texas matching five numbers for the $175,000 prize. Of those, two were purchased with the Megaplier feature. "Contrary to popular belief, not all the significant prizes are won in the major metropolitan areas, such as Houston and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex," said Greer. "In fact, four of the $175,000 prizes have been sold in cities along the Texas/Mexico border." Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million.
