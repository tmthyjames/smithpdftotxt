Mega MillionsTM Jackpot Could Reach Record Level In Texas' History
(Austin, December 19) - The Texas Lottery Commission, along with the member states of Mega MillionsTM, announced today that if no tickets match tonight's Mega Millions drawing numbers, plus the Mega Ball, that the Tuesday, December 23, drawing will be worth an estimated $100 million dollars. "Texans could see the highest-ever lottery jackpot for the state, come Saturday morning," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We promised players a game that would produce high level jackpots and be exciting. Not only did we reach that goal, we included a game feature that players told us they wanted - the Megaplier, a chance for players to increase their non-jackpot prizes." Projections for the Mega Millions' jackpots to reach levels of $100 million or more could occur approximately five times per year. Tonight's Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $85 million. It ties the current record for the highest-ever jackpot amount of Lotto TexasTM in March 2001.
