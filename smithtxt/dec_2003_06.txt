Duncanville Mega MillionsTM Winner Says $175,000 Prize Couldn't Have Come At Better Time

Isabel Rodriguez of Duncanville shows off her "Mega" smile for winning $175,000 in Tuesday's Mega Millions drawing.

(Austin, December 17) - Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM drawing produced two tickets that matched five numbers, but not the Mega Ball. Each ticket is worth $175,000. You would have thought by Isabel Rodriguez's reaction that she hit the $71 million jackpot instead. "I found out this morning, and I cried, screamed and jumped for joy," Rodriguez said. "I'm paying my house off and getting a car. I also plan to take care of my five children's future." The numbers drawn were: 47 - 16 - 31 - 24 - 46 and the Mega Ball number was 47. "This time of year, many of us have so much to be thankful for," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It is truly heartwarming to hear how Mrs. Rodriguez is using her Mega Millions winnings to secure the future of her children and family." Rodriguez purchased her winning ticket at My T Quick, located at 1422 Acton Avenue in Duncanville. The other ticket matching five numbers, but not the Mega Ball, was sold in Weslaco at Mid Valley Express. The store is located at 1006 N. Texas Boulevard. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $85 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.
