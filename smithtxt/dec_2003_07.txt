Grand Prairie Guy Gets 'Heck Of A Christmas' After Winning $5,000 Playing Mega MillionsTM

Martin Goana of Grand Prairie, who turned $5 into $5,000.

(Austin, December 11) - Martin Goana of Grand Prairie made his weekly stop to buy Lotto Texas® tickets on Tuesday and decided to purchase $5 worth of Mega MillionsTM tickets, since he was already there. Goana matched four numbers plus the Mega Ball for Tuesday's drawing. The numbers drawn were: 14 - 15 - 48 - 4 - 24 and the Mega Ball was 41. "Every day, I read The Dallas Morning News to check my numbers and this time, there they were, so I looked at the ticket a bunch of times, and finally figured out I actually won," he said. "It's going to be a heck of a Christmas, and now I have enough to paint my house, too." "The Texas Lottery is big on happy holidays, so Merry Christmas to Mr. Goana," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "I also know that this isn't the first time the Lottery helps out with household chores, which we're always happy to do, so happy house painting to Mr. Goana." The 49-year-old Grand Prairie resident has a secret plan in mind, too, but he's not telling his fiancé about it just yet. "I'm telling everybody I won the day after Christmas," he said. He purchased the winning ticket at Lucky 1 Food Mart, 1700 Park Row, Suite 100, in Arlington. The jackpot for Friday's Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $61 million.
