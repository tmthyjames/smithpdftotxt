San Antonio Woman Gets A Bigger Kitchen For Christmas From Hot Slots Instant Game

Graciela Briones of San Antonio, winner of a Hot Slots $20,000 prize.

(Austin, December 11) - Graciela Briones of San Antonio will expand her tiny kitchen as soon as the holidays end, thanks to the $20,000 prize she won playing Hot Slots, an instant game from the Texas Lottery®. "Since the Texas Lottery began in 1992, we've helped many of our winners build homes, businesses, new careers and lots of other things," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We're happy to be able to help Mrs. Briones with her dream kitchen." The 44-year-old housewife plans to tackle a few other things, too. "I have other projects I want to finish, including getting furniture," she said. Briones said she was at home when she scratched her $2 ticket and learned she'd won one of the top prizes. "I looked at the ticket, and then I looked at it again, and I didn't think it could be real," she said. "You really don't think you're going to win, and then there it is, a prize."
