Texas Lottery® Players Win Big In First Mega MillionsTM Drawing
(Austin, December 8) - Texas players did "Very well, thank you" in their first Mega Millions drawing. While no one in any of the eleven Mega Millions states won Friday night's $44 million jackpot, seven players in five states won the second prize of $175,000. A player who bought the ticket at the Carina Grocery in Fort Worth was one of those winners, along with three players in New York, and one each in Virginia, Georgia, and Michigan. Friday's drawing was also the first one that included the Texas-only option of a MegaplierTM that, for an additional dollar, allows players a chance to double, triple or quadruple their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings. The Megaplier number selected for Friday's drawing was a "4". "The third tier prize level is a great illustration of how the Megaplier works," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "There were 30 winners at this level in the 11 Mega Millions' states, and five of those winners are in Texas," explained Greer. "For all but one of those five Texas winners, the prize is $5,000. For that player in Texas who bought the Megaplier, the prize is four times that, for a cool $20,000." The $175,000 Texas winner did not "megaply" that purchase. Total Texas sales for Friday's drawing were just under $3.5 million, with $646,456 of that for the Megaplier. There were a grand total of 67,142 winning tickets in Texas for Friday's drawing. Of those, 15,331 are also Megaplier winning tickets. Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $54 million.
