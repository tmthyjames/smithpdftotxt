Tuesday Marks Last Mega MillionsTM Drawing Without Texas Players
(Austin, December 2) - Tuesday night's drawing for the $33 million Mega MillionsTM jackpot will be the last one where Texas players will not be holding tickets, and probably their breath, as the winning numbers are announced. Texas becomes the eleventh state to offer Mega MillionsTM tickets, when sales for the multi-state game start in Texas, Wednesday morning at 6 a. m. "Wednesday starts a new chapter in the history of the 'Games of Texas,' as we welcome Mega Millions into our product lineup," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "With Mega Millions on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Lotto Texas on Wednesdays and Saturdays, Texas players can now play a big jackpot game four nights a week." In the past year, Mega Millions jackpots have averaged $42.3 million. The largest Mega Millions jackpot was $183 million. The Big Game, Mega Millions predecessor, began in 1996 and had a $363 million jackpot in May 2000. The name changed in May 2002 with the creation of Mega Millions that featured a new matrix and additional states selling tickets. Lotto TexasTM was the Texas Lottery's first big jackpot game and just marked its eleventh anniversary last month. Like Mega Millions, Lotto Texas has a different matrix than when the game started in 1992. Today's Lotto Texas jackpots start at $4 million and have gone as high as $85 million. The odds of winning a Lotto jackpot are 1in 47.7 million. Overall odds of winning a prize in Lotto are 1 in 57. By adding Mega Millions to its product line-up, the Texas Lottery expects increase revenues the Texas Lottery generates for public education in Texas. The Legislative Budget Board has estimated that even with the cannibalization of other games like Lotto Texas taken into account, additional net revenue to the State for the Foundation School Fund will come to $101 million for the biennium. Texans join Mega Millions players in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Washington. Mega Millions drawings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. Each play costs a dollar. To play Mega Millions, players choose 5 numbers from 1 to 52, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 52. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $10 million and increases until it is won. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in approximately 135 million. The overall odds of winning any prize in Mega Millions are 1-in-43. In joining Mega Millions, Texas added its own twist to the game. For an extra dollar, Texas players will have the option of multiplying their non-grand/jackpot prize winnings two, three or four times through an add-on feature called the Megaplier.TM "We like to think of it as 'Texas-sizing' your winnings," explained Greer. "Let's say the number three is drawn as the Megaplier. A $2 prize for matching the Mega Ball is now $6 for those players who purchased the Megaplier feature. The $175,000 prize for matching five numbers, but not the Mega Ball, is now $525,000 for those players who purchased the Megaplier feature." Texas was able to join Mega Millions through the passage of HB 3459, which Governor Perry signed on June 10.
