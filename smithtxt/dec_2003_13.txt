Fort Worth's Own Hank Williams Has A Lot To Sing About With Texas Lottery® Win!
(Austin, December 1) - Hank A. Williams ­ "born and raised" in Fort Worth ­ has something to sing about. He just won $30,000 on a scratch off game from the Texas Lottery®. Williams, who has been in the U.S. Army for 15 years, was home for the holidays, visiting his mother in Fort Worth. He was out and about one morning, when he stopped at the Meadowbrook Food Store, and bought two 3 Card Cash tickets to go with his chocolate milk and a donut. "I saw the '$3' sign and thought, that's good, I won $3," Williams recalled. "Then I saw the zero and thought, $30 is even better." When Williams' continued scratching revealed the top cash prize of $30,000, he was quite excited. "We're very happy for Mr. Williams," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I'm glad we could play a small part in making his trip home for Thanksgiving one to remember." Williams will soon be heading back to base in Fort Drum, New York, but he has one more mission to accomplish before he leaves Texas. "December 2nd is my mom's birthday, so I'm going to give some of this to her, and then take care of paying off some bills," said Williams.
