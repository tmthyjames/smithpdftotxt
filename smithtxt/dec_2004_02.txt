"I Had A Reeeeally Good Christmas," Claims Corpus Christi Mega MillionsTM Winner

Patricia Higgins of Corpus Christi, winner of Friday's Mega Millions second-tier cash prize of $175,000.

(Austin, December 27) - Patricia Higgins' Christmas morning was first spent reading over Friday's Mega MillionsTM numbers and drinking a cup of coffee. Seconds later, it was spent realizing she had just matched five numbers from the Friday night drawing. "I remembered I had bought some lottery tickets and decided to check the numbers," said Higgins. "In the excitement of realizing I had matched five of them, I forgot to check the bonus ball. I thought I may have won the jackpot." Higgins didn't win the jackpot, as no ticket matched all five numbers and the Bonus Ball, but she did win the second-tier cash prize. Hers was the sole ticket sold in Texas worth $175,000. "I had no idea how much matching the five numbers would get me," she said. "My husband knew though, and I couldn't wait to collect it. I was a nervous wreck all weekend." The Higgins said that while they have no immediate plans for their holiday windfall, one of their nine grandchildren has asked for a surfboard. "What an exciting way to spend the holiday weekend," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Congratulations to Mrs. Higgins, and I'm very happy to hear what a wonderful Christmas she said she had." Higgins purchased her ticket at the Circle K #2136 store at 15233 SPID in Corpus Christi. Friday's Mega Millions numbers were: 09-20-22-41-42 and the Bonus Ball number was 10. Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $48 million.
