Houston Resident Claims $1 Million Top Prize In 12th Anniversary Million Scratch-Off Game

Long Nguyen of Houston today claimed the second and final $1 million top prize in the Texas Lottery 12th Anniversary Million scratch-off game.

(Austin, December 27) - Long Nguyen of Houston today claimed the second and final $1 million top prize in the Texas Lottery® 12th Anniversary Million scratch-off game. The $20 ticket was released in May in celebration of the Texas Lottery Commission's 12-year anniversary. Nguyen received the winning ticket a couple of weeks ago as a birthday gift from a family member. "This was definitely a birthday present I'll always remember," said Nguyen. "My family and I are very thankful for our good fortune." "They usually say it's better to give than to receive, though in this case, I'd say Mr. Nguyen got the better part of the deal," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery. "We waited a long time for our final 12th Anniversary Million winner, but what a great way to close out the year." Nguyen's winning ticket was purchased at the Super K Food Store located at 1007 1st Street East #A in Humble. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000. Nguyen requested minimum publicity. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org ...
