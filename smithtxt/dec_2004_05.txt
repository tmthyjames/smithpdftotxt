Austin Pinball Player Flips Over $33,000 Win

Brenda K. Fowler of Austin won $33,000, the top prize in the Pinball scratch-off game.

(Austin, December 22) - Longtime Austin educator Brenda K. Fowler retired just a few weeks ago and is planning a return to graduate school next month. She'll find her tuition a little easier to pay after winning $33,000, the top prize for the $3 Pinball scratch-off game from the Texas Lottery®. Fowler was joking with the clerk that sold her the ticket about wanting to be a big winner when she scratched it off and was shocked at what she discovered. "The clerk and I both examined and reexamined the ticket," said Fowler. "Then, the shouting, dancing, kissing and hugging commenced." Ms. Fowler, a regular scratch-off player, said she's returning to the University of Texas to work on her Ph.D. She said she'll apply much of her winnings toward her tuition and will also pay off some bills. "After a long career in education, I think Ms. Fowler's plan to use her Pinball winnings to help further her own education is especially appropriate, considering that about 30 cents of every dollar spent on Texas Lottery products goes to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in our state," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission.
