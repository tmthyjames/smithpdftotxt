Weekly Scratch-Off Sales Soar To Heights Unseen Since 1992 Texas Lottery® Start-Up
(Austin, December 21) - Sales of scratch-off tickets for the week ending December 18, amounted to $56.4 million, the third highest weekly total in the history of the Texas Lottery®. The top-two weekly scratch-off sales totals date back to the first weeks of Texas Lottery sales in June 1992. "With all the excitement surrounding the Lottery's start-up back in 1992, it's no surprise that the top two scratch-off sales weeks occurred in that period," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "But what's really impressive is that the excitement continues 12 years later. What a great week!" Texas Lottery scratch-off sales have been trending upward for the last month. Last week's sales were nearly $1.9 million, or 3.5 percent, higher than the previous week, and $11.9 million, or 26.9 percent, higher than the same week in 2003. Greer cited several factors that were contributing to the boost in sales, including a variety of price points, an attractive mix of new games and old favorites, as well as the holiday season and the Texas Lottery's first $30 scratch-off game, Holiday Millions Wishes. "I think a lot of folks are going to find their holiday stockings stuffed with Texas Lottery scratch offs," predicted Greer. "And of course, with almost 17,000 retailers statewide and a few shopping days left before Christmas, Texas Lottery tickets make a great option for last-minute gift buying."
