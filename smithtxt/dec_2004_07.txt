Cheerful Dallas Resident Claims Last Night's $625,000 Texas Two Step® Jackpot

Kenneth Hilliard of Dallas starts his holiday season winning a $625,000 Texas Two Step jackpot prize.

(Austin, December 17) - A very cheerful Kenneth Hilliard walked into the Texas Lottery® Dallas Claim Center today with the sole jackpot-winning ticket for last night's Texas Two Step® drawing. Hilliard claimed the $625,000 jackpot after learning he had won about 2 a.m. this morning. "I had gotten home from work and decided to check my numbers," said Hilliard. "I looked and saw that I matched the first two numbers, and then the rest of them, too. I started yelling real loud, but I got quiet real fast because I live in an apartment. I didn't want to wake anyone up." Hilliard matched the four numbers, 02 - 09 - 30 - 32, and Bonus Ball number, 21, for the jackpot prize. He purchased his ticket at the Sack' N Save #206, located at 2550 W. Redbird 100A Square 67. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $6,250 for selling the winning ticket. "Mr. Hilliard definitely has something to be cheerful about," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "A nice little $625,000 bonus from the Texas Lottery has a way of warming up anyone's holiday spirit." "It's a great feeling," said Hilliard. "I don't have words to describe it. I'm not going to go crazy with a spending frenzy or anything, but I am going to have some fun." Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $25 million and Saturday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $30 million.
