$50,000 Helps Austin Cash Zone Player Move Into the Retirement Zone

Austin's George R. Barnard Jr. won the the $50,000 top prize in the $5 Cash Zone scratch off game.

(Austin, December 16) - Austin's George R. Barnard Jr. thought he'd have to extend his highway department career for a while when he took out a loan on his retirement fund several years ago. However, the $50,000 top prize Barnard won in the $5 Cash Zone scratch off game earlier this week is helping to pave the way to an earlier retirement. "It was pretty hard to believe when I scratched off the numbers and saw that I'd won," said Barnard. "Now I can pay off my loan and retire two years earlier than I'd planned." Barnard says he plays all of the Texas Lottery® games and had been on a lucky streak lately with a couple of $100 winners, but never anything as big as his Cash Zone win. "It sounds like Cash Zone is going to help Mr. Barnard make a dream come true a couple of years early," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I wish him and his family well in his retirement, and I want to remind everyone to play the Games of Texas responsibly. Remember, it only takes one ticket to win!" Barnard purchased his winning Cash Zone ticket at the Speedy Stop #216 located at 9105 Hwy 290 East in Austin.
