The prestigious national award is the highest form of recognition in the area of governmental accounting and financial reporting, and its attainment represents a significant accomplishment by a government agency and its management. "This recognition is a great honor for our agency and well deserved by our hard-working Financial Administration team," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Their efforts are indicative of the commitment to excellence all of us share at the Texas Lottery." According to a statement released by GFOA, "The Texas Lottery Commission CAFR has been judged by an impartial panel to meet the high standards of the program, including demonstrating a constructive 'spirit of full disclosure' to clearly communicate its financial story and motivate potential users and user groups to read the CAFR." This is the second consecutive year that the Texas Lottery Financial Administration Division has been recognized by GFOA, a nonprofit professional association with offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C. GFOA serves approximately 15,000 government finance professionals.
