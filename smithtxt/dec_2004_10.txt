Florida Man Wins $175,000 Playing Mega MillionsTM In San Antonio

Winner Brian Heller of Zephyr Hills, Florida.

(Austin, December 15) - Brian Heller of Zephyr Hills, Florida, came to Texas to celebrate Thanksgiving, and instead turned into a winner. He won $175,000 playing Mega MillionsTM for the drawing on November 30. "I bought five dollars worth of tickets for the drawing on the 30th at the HEB store," Heller said. "I bought five for that drawing and five for the previous drawing, and I told my daughter what the numbers were on my tickets. Lori and I returned to Florida right after that." Heller and his wife, Lori, were in town visiting his daughter and grandchildren for Thanksgiving. He purchased his tickets from a Self-Service Terminal (SST) at the HEB located at 910 Kitty Hawk Road in Universal City. "I was in utter disbelief when my daughter called me to tell me about the numbers," he said. "In fact, I'm kind of shaky today. It's just disbelief." "Our winners come from far and wide, as Florida resident Brian Heller proves" said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The Games of Texas have created winners in at least three countries and several states that we know of, and no telling where else. The buzz about our games precedes them wherever they may be taken, whether it's here in Texas or somewhere else, and our games have made a reputation for themselves as being fun and exciting. Brian Heller certainly thinks they are." Heller said he planned to go eat somewhere to celebrate. "I plan to get some advice from San Antonians about this before I go anywhere," he said. As for what he's going to do with his prize besides go to dinner, Heller said he had special plans already made.

"I'm going to set money aside for the education of my grandkids," he said. "Then I'm going to buy a car here in San Antonio and drive back to Florida." After Heller collected his prize, he made sure to buy some tickets for tonight's drawing. "I buy Texas Lottery tickets every time I'm here," he said. "This is no exception." Mega Millions last week completed its first year of sales in Texas, during which 14 players megaplied their second-tier prize of $175,000 and collected prizes ranging from $350,000 to $700,000. Heller did not purchase the MegaplierTM feature. "The proceeds from all of our games benefit the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education," Greer said. " Mega Millions proceeds are part of that, too. For every dollar spent purchasing a Mega Millions ticket, about 38 percent of that dollar goes to the Foundation School Fund." Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $28 million. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $25 million.
