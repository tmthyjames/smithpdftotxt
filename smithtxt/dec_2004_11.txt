Texas Lottery® Revenue To State Tops $12 Billion
(Austin, December 13) - With last week's transfer of $83 million to the state of Texas, the Texas Lottery Commission surpassed yet another major milestone in its 12-year history. As of December 6, the total revenue generated for the state by the Texas Lottery® is $12,066,718,703. "The Texas Lottery was specifically created to generate revenue for Texas and surpassing the $12 billion mark is truly a significant landmark in the history of our state and this agency," said Reagan E. Greer, executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Millions of Texans enjoy playing and winning the Games of Texas every day, and with about 30 cents of every dollar spent on Texas Lottery products going to the Foundation School Fund, the most important winner of all is public education." The Foundation School Fund, administered by the Texas Education Agency, assists public education in Texas at a local level by contributing to teacher salaries, administration and educational resources. Since 1997, transfers from the Texas Lottery to the Foundation School Fund total more than $6.8 billion. Prior to 1997, proceeds from the Texas Lottery were allocated to the state's General Revenue Fund.
