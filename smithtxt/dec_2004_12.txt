Austin Texas Two Step® Winner Finds 1.35 Million Reasons To Be Thankful This Holiday Season
(Austin, December 9) - Austinite Curtis C. King's shopping trip for pecan pie ingredients just before Thanksgiving turned into a holiday memory he'll cherish for years. Along with pie crust and filling, King picked up $10 worth of Texas Two Step® tickets for the drawing held on Thanksgiving Day, November 25. King's numbers, 4 - 17 - 26 - 27 and Bonus Ball 9, matched those drawn and King was the sole claimant of the $1.35 million jackpot. "I didn't get around to checking the tickets until Sunday," said King. "I was so shocked, all I could think to do was kneel down and say a prayer of thanks." King says he plays Lotto Texas® more often than Texas Two Step, but was attracted by the latter game's elevated jackpot and odds. He also had a hunch. "I just remember thinking that maybe with the holiday, some people might be too busy to play and my odds might be better," said King. The hunch paid off. King says doesn't have any concrete plans for his winnings yet, but he thinks he might look at buying a new car and helping out his family. "Well, I want to congratulate Mr. King for what truly was a memorable Thanksgiving," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And in this season of giving, I think it's great that he's including others in his plans for his winnings." King purchased his ticket at the Stop 'N Go #2141 located in Austin. In June, the Texas Lottery® changed the draw nights for Texas Two Step to Monday and Thursday nights. The change gives players an opportunity to play for a jackpot-style game every night of the week, except Sunday. Players choose four numbers and a separate Bonus Ball number for a chance to win the jackpot. Jackpots start at $200,000. To date, 12 single-ticket holders have claimed a prize of $1 million or more.
