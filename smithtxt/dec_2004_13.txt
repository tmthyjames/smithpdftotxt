Cash Five Winner Allen London of Dallas shows off his $39,264 ceremonial check.

(Austin, December 7) - Allen London of Dallas enjoys going to casinos in Las Vegas every two or three months, and he's been a success at the tables, he says. So when he won $39,264 in the November 29 Cash FiveTM drawing, he affectionately called his prize "coffee money." "I've won more playing in Las Vegas," London said. "But I never fail to buy my lottery tickets. I'm going to help my sisters and their kids, and donate to my church, too, with this money." London purchased his Cash Five ticket at the Overton Stop & Save Food Store, 1406 E. Overton Road in Dallas. The store is eligible to receive a one percent bonus of the jackpot, which come to $392.64 "A $39,000 prize can buy you lots and lots of coffee," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "But coffee or not, it's clear Mr. London will be generous with his family and his church. That's really making the most out of his prize." London says his favorite game of all is craps. "I like to think of myself as lucky, that's why I play." He found out he'd won by reading the Lottery results in The Dallas Morning News while at the breakfast table.
