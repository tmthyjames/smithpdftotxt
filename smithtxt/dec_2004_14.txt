Mega Year Ends With Millions Won
(Austin, December 6) - Exactly 366 days passed between December 3, 2003, and December 3, 2004, marking the first year Texas participated in the multi-state Mega MillionsTM lottery game. Sales totaled more than $289 million, of which $234 million were Mega Millions ticket sales and $55 million were made up of MegaplierTM ticket sales. Texas ranks in the top three among the participating states in total sales. "With the signing of House Bill 3459 allowing Texas to join a multijurisdictional lottery game, it set into motion one of the highest sales years in the history of the Texas Lottery, and enabled us to transfer more than $1 billion to the Foundation School Fund for fiscal year 2004," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. Greer formally signed the multijurisdictional lottery game agreement with Mega Millions on October 16, 2003, making Texas the 11th state to sell tickets for Mega Millions, a multi-state game known for its big jackpots. During the first year, Texans had the chance to play for 19 jackpots that reached levels of $100 million or more. The highest Mega Millions jackpot in the last year was $290 million. Players won more than $118 million in cash prizes with Mega Millions, and an additional $22 million was paid out to players who chose the Megaplier feature. The Megaplier feature allows players the chance to double, triple or quadruple any Mega Millions non-grand/jackpot prize. During the first year of sales, 14 players Megaplied the second-tier prize of $175,000, and collected prizes of $350,000 to $700,000. "This first year was made more exciting with Texas' first Mega millionaire, Ut Van Nguyen of Carrollton," Greer said. He claimed a $101 million Mega jackpot in October. Greer also noted that for every dollar spent purchasing a Mega Millions ticket, about 38 percent of that dollar goes to the Foundation School Fund. Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
