Last Minute Decision To Play Pays Off In Millions For Lotto Texas Player
(Austin, February 20) - - Today Luis Uribe of Carrollton received $2.8 million for a quick decision he made while stopping at Quiktrip #903 in Dallas to buy cigarettes. I thought I may as well get some Lotto tickets too while I was there," Uribe said. "I just decided to play all of a sudden and it turned out I'm a winner." Uribe's Quick Pick ticket was one of two jackpot winning Lotto Texas tickets sold for the drawing held Saturday, February 2nd, worth an estimated $10 million. He chose the Cash Value Option and received a total payout of $2,806,986. "The day after the drawing I had to go the store to get ice, and I got the results while I was there. Later on when I got home, I decided I better check my numbers and I couldn't believe what I saw," said Uribe. "I called my father-in-law and my brother-inlaw to see if they would go to another store and get the numbers also." Uribe's in-laws called back later to confirm what he had already seen. "They told me I had won," he said. "At first I thought they were just reading the numbers I had given them back to me. It took me awhile to believe it." Uribe and his wife, Angelica, are expecting their first baby in a few months and he explained how this money would help with future plans. "I'd like to go to school and study business management," he said. "One day, I want to own my own store and manage it. Other than that, we haven't really thought about everything else yet." The retailer, Quiktrip #903, is located at 2968 Forest Lane, and is eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent --$50,000 -- for selling one of the two jackpot winning Lotto tickets. The winning numbers drawn were 02-10-21-29-30-18. Max Shannon of the Humble/Atascocita area claimed the other jackpot-winning ticket on Friday, February 8th. Shannon purchased his ticket at the Albertson's located at 7506 FM 1960 East in Atascocita. He elected the 25-year annuity option, and received an initial payment of $200,000. He will receive the same amount every February 15th for the next 24 years, for a total prize of $5,000,000. "This has changed my life," Uribe said. "I would recommend playing to everybody." The jackpot for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing is worth an estimated $4 million.
