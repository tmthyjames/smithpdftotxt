Fort Worth Lottery Retailer Gets A Lift From Selling Winning Lotto Texas Ticket
(Austin, February 15) - ­ Sankar Saha, owner of Riverside Food Mart in Fort Worth, had no idea on December 27th he was about to start experiencing the thrill that comes when a Texas Lottery retailer sells a jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket. His store sold the only winning Lotto ticket for the December 26th drawing that was worth an estimated $36 million. Since then, people from all over have been buying lottery tickets from his store.

"I've had people from Oklahoma come buy their tickets here," Saha said. "My overall lottery sales have doubled." The excitement started when Saha arrived at his store, located at 350 N. Riverside Drive, the day after the drawing. His curiosity peaked when he noticed a local news station van and reporter camped out waiting for him. "I saw Channel 5 (KXAS-TV, Fort Worth) sitting there, and I walked up to the people to find out what was going on," Saha explained. "That's when the reporter told me that the winning ticket was sold here. "I didn't even know, and I couldn't believe it," he said. "I was really, really excited. I built this store from the ground up. I spend an average of 12 hours a day, seven days a week here, and I get a lot of satisfaction from it. This was something though, a good thing." Today, the Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud presented the Riverside Food Mart owner with a ceremonial check for $360,000 for selling the sole winning Lotto ticket. "We, at the Texas Lottery, extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Saha for adding his store's name to the list of lucky retailers to sell a jackpot winning Lotto ticket," said Cloud. "His store makes number eleven in the Fort Worth area to reach this honor." Saha told lottery officials that while there aren't any definite plans for the bonus, he has already started making some improvements in the store.
