Onalaska Cash Five Winner Plans To Pay Off Home Mortgage

Nancy Fear of Onalaska plans to pay off her home mortgage two years early.

(Austin, February 21) - Nancy Fear of Onalaska plans to pay off her home mortgage two years early. She says she'll be able to accomplish that feat because she won Cash FiveTM on Tuesday, February 18, when the top-prize was $58,676. She claimed her prize from the Texas LotteryTM Lufkin Claim Center on Thursday. "I think it's all so wonderful," said Fear. "I didn't even think to check my ticket until this morning. Sometimes you just forget those things." Fear explained she looked up the numbers on her favorite website and saw that she had matched all the numbers. It didn't take long for her to figure out how much her ticket was going to net her. "I saw immediately that I had won the only top prize, but I still went to the store where I bought the ticket and told the clerk to run it through the machine," Fear said. Fear purchased her ticket at Brookshire Brothers #71, located at 14981 U.S. Highway 190 in Onalaska. The retail owner is eligible for a bonus of one percent, or $586.76, for selling the top-prize-winning Cash Five ticket. Fear told Texas Lottery officials that besides paying off the mortgage on her home on Lake Livingston, she plans on paying off some other little bills. She said she intends to continue operating her and her husband's small restaurant between Trinity and Onalaska, called the Silver Spur. Cash Five is drawn every Monday through Saturday at 10:12 p.m. and costs $1 to play. Players choose five numbers from one to 37, and can win prizes for matching two, three, four or five numbers. Players win $2 for matching only two numbers. Saturday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $7 million.
