Dalhart Family Uses 10-Year-Old, Hand-Selected Numbers To Win $5 Million Lotto Texas Jackpot

Cecelia and Gene Leroy McDaneld today claimed the $5 million Lotto Texas jackpot at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin.

(Austin, February 21) - For a Dalhart family, using the same family-chosen Lotto TexasTM numbers for 10 years has paid off. Gene Leroy McDaneld, managing partner of GCT & T Partners, today claimed the $5 million Lotto Texas jackpot at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters. McDaneld chose the annuity option for the drawing on February 5, and will receive an initial payment of $265,211, before taxes, with 24 annual payments of $200,000 paid every February 15. Joined in Austin by his wife, Cecelia, and their two daughters, Tina and Tami, McDaneld explained that when Lotto Texas started in November 1992, he, his wife and his daughters selected five sets of six numbers. The February 5 winning numbers were: 33 ­ 5 ­ 21 ­ 35 ­ 48 ­ 13. "We would match three numbers every once in a while, and even got four numbers once or twice, but it's really hard to believe when six numbers match," said Cecelia McDaneld, 50, who did her part by buying the winning ticket at Depot Discount Liquor, 711 S. Highway 87 in Dalhart. The retailer is eligible for a $50,000 bonus. Cecelia McDaneld has been working two part-time jobs in addition to her full-time job to make ends meet during rough economic times. When she realized that her numbers had won, she said, "My heart went to my stomach. I felt relieved that this money would help us, but I also felt nervous about the money." Gene McDaneld, an irrigation motor mechanic, said he intends to continue playing the same numbers and looks forward to seeing more of his wife, since she's thinking about taking a breather from her part-time jobs. "We want to pay off debt and go from there," said Cecelia McDaneld. "We're also hopeful that we can help our youngest daughter, Tami, finish college. We're already so proud of our oldest daughter, Tina, who is teaching."
