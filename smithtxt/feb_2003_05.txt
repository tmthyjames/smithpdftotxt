(Austin, February 21) - One of the owners of the Horizon #2 store in Sanger today received a retailer bonus check of $270,000 for selling the $27 million Lotto TexasTM jackpot-winning ticket for the November 9, 2002 drawing. Rick Hassan, who owns the store with his brother, Nick, accepted the check from Texas Lottery Commission On-Line Product Manager Robert Tirloni. "On behalf of the Lottery, I want to congratulate Mr. Hassan for selling a $27 million Lotto Texas jackpot-winning ticket," Tirloni said. "This bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot is our way of thanking our retailers for the hard work they do for the Lottery and Lottery players." Hassan was out of town the night of the drawing. He was informed by his manager that they had sold the winning ticket. "I knew it was a big jackpot that night, and so when he told me, I became very excited," Hassan said. "This couldn't have come at a better time. With the downturn in the economy, this bonus is really going to help our stores. I'm going to give a small amount to charity and turn the rest of it back into the business. I'm really grateful to the Lottery for having a bonus program like this." The sole winner of the jackpot was Darrell W. Thompson of Ada, Oklahoma. He was on a bus trip with other parents chaperoning a group of students who came to see a Dallas Mavericks basketball game. Thompson and the group stopped at the Horizon #2 after one of the students on the bus told him he needed to go to the bathroom. While waiting, he bought 10 dollars' worth of Quick Pick tickets. The winner collected a Cash Value Option prize in the amount of $17.3 million. The winning numbers were 32-37-34-21-17-
