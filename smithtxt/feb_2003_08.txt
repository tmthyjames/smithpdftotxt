(Austin, February 7) - An Arlington woman who routinely buys Lotto TexasTM tickets when she meets friends for lunch at a Grand Prairie Kroger store decided to spend her lunch hour today at the Texas Lottery Commission. Rosalie Perkov, trustee of Perkov Family Trust, claimed her share of the $53 million Lotto Texas jackpot from the drawing on January 22, 2003. Perkov chose the Cash Value Option, and will receive $16.2 million before taxes. Perkov bought the winning Lotto Texas ticket at Kroger 817, 2525 West I-20 in Grand Prairie. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of $250,000. At today's ceremonial check presentation, Perkov, 73, explained that she used to work at the grocery store before her retirement last February. "I get together with my friends at Kroger's and we have lunch," explained Perkov. "I used to work there when it was Winn Dixie, so I go inside and say hello and buy a couple of Lotto Texas tickets. This time I told my son I'd go in on some Lotto Texas tickets with him, so I went in and bought three Quick Pick tickets." Four of Perkov's regular lunch dates used to work with her at Winn Dixie during her nearly six years at the grocery store. With a large family ­ nine children, 13 grandchildren, and two great grandchild born a day before the $53 million Lotto Texas drawing ­ Perkov said her plans for the windfall include her family. "I just want the kids to be set," explained Perkov. "My husband and I moved here from upstate New York to be near family and also to get dialysis treatments for my husband on a schedule that isn't always influenced by the weather. We still have sons in New York and a son and daughters in the Metroplex, and we just want to know they're alright."

Perkov's family also played a role in her learning she had the winning ticket. "My daughter came to the house and we watched the drawing on Channel 5 (KXAS-TV).

The winning numbers drawn were: 46 ­ 42 ­ 17 ­ 28 ­ 25 ­ 40. The other winning ticket was sold in Brownsville and was claimed at Texas Lottery headquarters on Monday, February 3, by Victor Delgadillo, trustee of Victory Trust. The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $4 million. ....
