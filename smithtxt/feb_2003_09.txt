It's Déjà Vu All Over Again For Whitney Store Owner; Gets Bonus For Selling Second Lotto Texas Jackpot-Winning Ticket

GTECH sales representative Christy Donner, store owners Alan and Sharon Nisbet and store manager Susan Gilleland show off the $90,000 ceremonial check.

(Austin, February 6) - Sharon Nisbet had a coveted déjà vu experience as a Texas LotteryTM retailer. As one of the owners of the S&A Express in Whitney, she sold the second Lotto TexasTM jackpot-winning ticket ever sold in Whitney. She sold the first as co-owner of another store. Selling the jackpot-winning ticket carries a bonus of one percent of the advertised jackpot for eligible retailers. She and her husband, Alan, found out from her daughter while they were out of town that the winning ticket had been sold in Whitney for the $9 million Lotto Texas drawing on November 23, 2002. At that time, however, they didn't know their outlet had done it. "Sharon and I knew we hadn't sold each other a ticket, but my wife actually thought that maybe we had sold the winner," Mr. Nisbet said. "I said to her, 'Come on, what are the odds of that happening?' " "It's just unbelievable the way it's happened," Mrs. Nisbet said. "One of my clerks called and told me that the claimants had come in to check their numbers and that sure enough, we sold it. It was shocking. Alan just about went crazy." He says the shock of it still hasn't diminished. "We still look at each other from time to time and ask ourselves if it's really real." Whitney has a population of approximately 3,000, so news travels at the speed of light around town. "Receiving this bonus is wonderful, but it's also been a bunch of fun," Mr. Nisbet said. "Lots of people started coming to the store after the news got out. They think we're the lucky store now, which is great because now everybody wants to buy their Lottery tickets here. It's just been more fun than I ever thought it would be." The Nisbets opened their store approximately two years ago. They plan to roll most of their bonus back into the store.
