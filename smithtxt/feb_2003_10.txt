Lotto Texas Winner From Rio Grande Valley Claims Share of $53 Million Jackpot

Victor Delgadillo, and his wife, Paula, co-trustees, from San Juan, Texas, received a ceremonial check at the Texas Lottery Commission headquarters.

(Austin, February 3) - Victory Trust today claimed its share of the $53 million Lotto TexasTM jackpot from the drawing on January 22, 2003. Victor Delgadillo, and his wife, Paula, co-trustees, from San Juan, Texas, received a ceremonial check at the Texas Lottery Commission headquarters for their share of the prize, which comes to $16.2 million before taxes. "I never imagined that I could win," explained Delgadillo. "We were on the way to the dentist in Matamoros and we stopped for gas. My wife went in to pay and decided to buy a few tickets. The clerk thought she wanted scratch-offs, but she insisted on two Lotto Texas tickets." The Delgadillos almost forgot about the tickets, especially since Delgadillo was getting over his dental procedure, but the morning after the drawing Delgadillo dropped his wallet and the ticket came fluttering out. "I had just sent my son to the convenience store to check the results on an older Lotto Texas ticket and I sent him out again," he explained. Delgadillo, 51, and his wife, 53, bought the winning Quick Pick Lotto Texas ticket at Speedy Stop #80, located at 1725 International Boulevard in Brownsville. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of $250,000. Natives of Guadalajara, Mexico, the Delgadillos came to the United States in 1987 in search of the American dream, first to California and then settling in San Juan. Delgadillo, one of 18 children, remembers the sacrifices he and his wife made. "We sacrificed a lot to send three of our four children to college so that they would be successful," said Delgadillo, partner in a trucking business. "We're proud of our children, how they have worked hard to become professionals, always aware of their principles, and that's the greatest prize we could have.

thought possible. "We were watching a story on Televisión Azteca, a Mexican television channel, that showed how these children in Mexico were having to walk up to an hour to and from school because there weren't buses or cars," continued Delgadillo. "They were needing bicycles and my wife and I talked about how nice it would be to have some extra money to just load up a bunch of bicycles in a semi-trailer and deliver them. We still want to do that." The second winning ticket was sold in Grand Prairie, Kroger 817, 2525 West I-20, and has not yet been claimed. The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $5 million. ....
