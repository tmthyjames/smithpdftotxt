It's A Hummer-Dinger Of A Win For Bertram Mega MillionsTM $175,000 Winner

David Hammer of Bertram, who collected a $175,000 prize that he won in the February 10 Mega Millions drawing.

(Austin, February 24) - David Hammer of Bertram collected a $175,000 prize on Monday that he won in the February 10 Mega MillionsTM drawing, and promptly announced that he's buying a Hummer vehicle very soon. "The first thing I'm going to do is pay off a whole ton of bills," Hammer said. "But then, I'm getting a Hummer. I know which one I'm getting, too. It's a used one that's ready to go in Indiana. The thing is you just don't think you're going to win. My heart just about came out of my chest." Hammer bought his five tickets in Bertram at the Travel Mart Convenience Store, 324 Highway 29 East. "Like so many other people who don't believe you can win, Mr. Hammer was proven wrong, much to his happiness," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery®. "Most of our winners are just like Mr. Hammer; they pay off their bills and buy themselves the best thing of all, peace of mind. That will make Mr. Hammer hum as he's driving along in his Hummer." Hammer said he found out he won when he stopped for gas on his way to work with his partner. "I was standing at the pump circling the numbers on my ticket as I read them from a winning-numbers printout, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing," he said. "My partner saw the ticket and said I won a bunch of money." Hammer ran back into the store and asked the clerk to run his ticket through the terminal.

"It said I had to come to Austin," he said. "I was so happy that I grabbed her and started kissing her. We were both real surprised." Hammer said he's been playing the same numbers since the Lottery started. "They don't mean anything, I just picked them out a long time ago," he said. "I decided then just to stick with them, and it paid off." The prize for matching five numbers but not the Mega Ball is $175,000. Hammer collected that plus $2. On one of his other five tickets, he had also matched the Mega Ball, which brings a prize of $2. The winning numbers were 32-22-10-3-7, and the Mega Ball was 23. The Mega Millions jackpot prize for tonight's drawing is an estimated $10 million. The Lotto TexasTM jackpot for Wednesday night's draw is an estimated $12 million.
