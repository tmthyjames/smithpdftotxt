Players And State Of Texas Come Out Big Winners With Friday's Mega MillionsTM Game
(Austin, February 23) - It was a box office hit for Texas Lottery® players and the State of Texas on Friday night. Players in and around Texas put their dollars down for a shot at the $230 million Mega MillionsTM jackpot, and the State of Texas came away with the highest sales week since June 2002. "Players are definitely starting to learn all about the Mega Millions game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Sales totaled $12.2 million leading up to Friday night's drawing, with $9.5 million of that coming in on Friday. "Texas' Megaplier game feature accounted for 20 percent of those sales," he added. Although no Texan won the grand jackpot, the third highest in Mega Millions history, there were six tickets that matched the second prize tier, each worth $175,000. Those tickets were sold in Austin, Fort Worth, Houston, Richmond, San Antonio and Weatherford. "Overall, there were 296,810 winning tickets sold in Texas," said Greer. "Of those, 49,995 tickets were purchased with the Megaplier feature and allowed those players to quadruple their prize amounts. We paid out over $3 million in prizes to players across the state." Had the ticket matching all five numbers and the gold Mega Ball been sold in Texas, the retail owner would have been eligible to receive a bonus of one million dollars. "It was a tremendously successful week for Texas," said Greer. "We may not have sold the jackpot ticket, but Texas came out a big winner with total sales from all games coming in at $82.3 million. "It proves our commitment to the state that with the decision to add Mega Millions to the lottery game mix, we're generating additional revenue for the Foundation School Fund. We want to emphasize that an average of 30 cents of each of those 82.3 million dollars goes straight to the state to help fund public education in Texas." Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million and Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $12 million.
