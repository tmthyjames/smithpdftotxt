Yee-Hah! It's Times Square For Friday's $222 Million Mega MillionsTM Jackpot
(Austin, February 19) - Texas Lottery players will be singing "New York, New York," as they watch Friday night's eyepopping $222 million Mega MillionsTM jackpot drawing when it takes place in legendary Times Square. "When you look up 'excitement' in the dictionary, you'll find a picture of Times Square," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Not only is the Mega Millions jackpot up to an estimated $222 million today, now we're going to draw the numbers in one of the world's most famous sites, a place that's synonymous with fun and excitement, which is what Mega Millions is all about." The directors of the 11 lotteries that participate in Mega Millions earlier today boosted the size of the jackpot from an estimated $215 million to an estimated $222 million. "We're also going to be watching our border area sales very closely," Greer said. "Players in the neighboring states to our east and west that also have lotteries are undoubtedly keeping an eye on our $222 million Mega Millions jackpot. We know they'll be coming over to buy tickets. I also want to remind them and all our players to play responsibly. It's only a game, after all." The drawing is broadcast at 10:12 p.m., Central Standard Time. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at www.txlottery. org.
