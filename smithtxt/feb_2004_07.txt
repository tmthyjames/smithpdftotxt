San Antonio Texas Lottery® Winner Makes Winning Sound So Simple

Dean Yannuzzi has big plans for his $10,000 Texas Lottery prize - buy a few more scratch off games!

(Austin, February 18) - It sounds so easy to win if you're talking to Dean Yannuzzi about Texas Lottery® scratch off games. What's his philosophy? "Whenever I win, no matter if it's on a $1, $5 or $20 scratch game, I always turnaround and buy some more with my winnings," Yannuzzi explained. "I like to play the $5 and $20 games mostly, because those are the big winners." The San Antonio resident put his theory to the test yesterday when he purchased a Texas Lottery Casino Action instant ticket, and won $10,000. "I've been playing since the first year of the Texas Lottery," Yannuzzi said. "This is the most I've won at one time. I'm going out right away and buy a few more. Maybe I'll win the BIG one for Casino Action." The $20 instant ticket has a top cash prize of one million dollars. "Many of our players like the higher priced instant tickets because of the larger cash prizes offered," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "These tickets also offer great overall odds of winning a prize. Casino Action players have a one in 2.86 of winning a prize, including $20 ones." As of today, there are two $1,000,000 prizes, three $100,000 prizes and six $10,000 prizes left unclaimed.
