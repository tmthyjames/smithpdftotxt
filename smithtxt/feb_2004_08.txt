Tonight's $177 Million Mega MillionsTM Jackpot Is Biggest Ever For Texas Lottery® Players
(Austin, February 17) - Texas Lottery players have the opportunity to buy a ticket for the largest jackpot ever offered in Texas, with tonight's Mega MillionsTM drawing boasting an estimated $177 million jackpot. "Tonight's $177 million prize is the largest ever offered in Texas and more than twice as big as our $85 million record for a Lotto Texas jackpot," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "As much as we want to see a Mega Millions jackpot winner in Texas, I urge our players to 'Play Responsibly' because it only takes one ticket to win." Tickets are available at any of the more than 16,000 Texas Lottery retailers and can be purchased up until 9:45 p.m. this evening. "Even if we don't have a Texas Mega Millions jackpot winner tonight, Texas still comes out ahead," explained Greer. " Mega Millions is just like every other Texas Lottery game where an average of 30 cents from every one dollar ticket purchase goes to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in Texas." If there are no winners tonight, the Mega Millions jackpot for Friday will be an estimated $215 million.
