Loyal Texas Two Step® Player From Copperas Cove Claims $400,000 Jackpot Prize

Debra Clayton of Copperas Cove is Central Texas' newest Texas Two Step winner - collected $400,000 from Feb. 6 drawing.

(Austin, February 13) - Debra Faye Clayton said she's played Texas Two Step® since "Day One" and thinks of it as her game. Today, the Copperas Cove woman claimed the biggest prize she's ever won on this Texas Lottery® game, a $400,000 jackpot from the drawing on February 6. Clayton bought her winning ticket at RACETRAC on 2419 U.S. Highway 190 in Copperas Cove. The retailer, who is eligible for a bonus of $4,000 for selling the winning ticket, played a part in giving Mrs. Clayton the good news. "I went to the RACETRAC on Tuesday to buy my tickets for that night's drawing, and the clerk said someone from Copperas Cove had won on Friday," Clayton explained. "I said 'That's nice for them, but I'm going to win one of these days.' " She had the clerk check her tickets from Friday and was surprised when the clerk told her she needed to go to a Texas Lottery Claim Center to claim the prize for one of them. It wasn't until the clerk gave her a printout of Friday's numbers that she learned her day had come and she was already a winner. "We looked at the winning numbers from Friday, and there they were - all my numbers," she laughed. "Every one of them."

The winning numbers for February 6 were: 3 - 4 - 7 - 30 and the Bonus Ball was 2. Clayton said she plays those numbers because they are a combination of family birthdays. "They're special to me because those people are special," she said. "Texas Two Step is a fun game to play, and Mrs. Clayton's prize shows how fun it is to win," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. Texas Two Step jackpots start at $200,000. To play, players choose four numbers from 1 to 35, and one Bonus Ball number from a second set of numbers from 1 to 35. To win the jackpot, players' numbers must match all four numbers and the Bonus Ball. In winning the jackpot, Clayton beat odds of one in approximately 1.8 million. She said she plans to use her winnings to pay off some bills and make some home repairs. She also plans to put some away for when she and her husband, Sonny, retire again. The Claytons are originally from North Carolina and are retired military. Though Clayton braved the weather this morning to come claim her prize at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin, she said she wasn't taking any chances that the weather would get in the way of her buying tickets for tonight's game. "I'll stop here in Austin and get my Two Step tickets for tonight," she said. "And I'm going to take a chance on that Mega Millions jackpot, too." Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is $250,000. Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is $150 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at www.txlottery. org.
