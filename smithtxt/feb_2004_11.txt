Houston Man Comes In Out Of The Rain And Claims $175,000 Mega MillionsTM Prize

Mark Smith of Houston, winner of a $175,000 prize in Mega Millions.

(Austin, February 11) - Mark G. Smith took the afternoon off from his job at Toshiba International in Houston. Seems he had a bit of business to conduct on this rainy Wednesday afternoon. First "to do" was go to the Texas Lottery Commission's Houston Claim Center and cash in his winning Mega MillionsTM ticket from last night's drawing. Smith's ticket matched five numbers but not the Mega Ball, winning him $175,000. "This couldn't have come at a better time," said Smith. Smith said he had a rough time leading up to his win. The flat tire he had on the way home last night took longer to fix since he just had wrist surgery. Once he was on his way again, he stopped at Champions Liquor on Jones Road in Houston, where he always buys his Texas Lottery® tickets. Smith said he never spends more than two dollars, and so he asked the clerk for two Quick Picks. Smith's ticket was one of three sold in Texas that qualified for the $175,000 prize. None of these three second-prize winning tickets were purchased with the MegaplierTM feature, which would have made the prize $350,000, since last night's Megaplier was a "2". But Smith said he's very content with what he won. "We're happy for Mr. Smith," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "He played the game the way he likes to and he's happy with the outcome."

There is one thing he regrets about his win, however. Smith said he couldn't sleep so he logged on to the Texas Lottery Web site around 3 a.m. and "started shaking." "The only bad thing was I couldn't call anyone at 3 o'clock in the morning to say I won," he laughed. "I had to wait until later this morning and call my brother." As he left the Claim Center, Smith told Lottery officials he had another stop to make ­ he was going to deposit his winnings in the bank and pay off some credit cards. And he has another errand already planned for Saturday. He's going to get some Harley chrome for his "Road King" motorcycle. "This is fantastic," he said, heading back out into the rain. The numbers drawn in Tuesday's Mega Millions drawing were: 3-7-10-22-32, and the Mega Ball was 23. No tickets in any of the eleven states that offer Mega Millions matched all five numbers and the Mega Ball for the $121 million jackpot. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $150 million, the second largest jackpot Texas players have had a chance to play for since Texas joined the multi-state game.
