First Million Dollar Winner With Texas Lottery® New Scratch Game - Casino Action

Cathy Tatsch of Harper is presented her million dollar prize by Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer

(Austin, February 9) - Today, Cathy Tatsch of Harper became the first winner of the top cash prize of the newest Texas Lottery® scratch off game, Casino Action. Tatsch initially mistook the prize as $1,000, but a quick check at a local lottery retailer quickly showed her that she would need to multiply that winning by 1,000. "At first, I didn't see how much it was worth. I thought it was $1,000," she said. "When the clerk checked it, the terminal said it was 'over the limit' that they could pay me. That's when I realized it was really worth a million dollars." Casino Action, the Lottery's newest $20 scratch off game, was released on January 23. Overall odds of winning any prize in Casino Action are 1 in 2.86 including break-even prizes. Cash prizes, other than the $1,000,000 prize, include: $100,000, $10,000, $4,000, $2,000, $1,000, $400, $200, $100, $80, $40, and $20. As of today, there are TWO top cash prizes left unclaimed. "Casino Action is the fourth Texas Lottery $20 scratch off we've released to our players," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It hasn't taken long to notice how much our players really enjoy the game. After its first week of sales, it was the top selling ticket for the week ending January 31. It was a pleasure to meet Cathy, our first million dollar winner for our current number one scratch off."
