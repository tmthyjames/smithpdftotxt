It's A Rowboat, Not A Ship But It's Coming In For Red Rock Texas Lottery® Winner

James W. Russell, Cash Five winner from Red Rock.

(Austin, February 9) - James W. Russell of Red Rock is thrilled to have his 'rowboat, not ship come in,' decked out as a $21,219 Cash FiveTM prize from the Texas Lottery®. "I woke up around midnight Saturday and got on the Internet to check my numbers at the Lottery web page," he said. "I saw the first three numbers and thought it was nice, but then I saw the rest and just couldn't believe it. Then, when I tried to go back to sleep, I couldn't." The next morning, he e-mailed his family members around the country and titled his missive "My Rowboat Came In." By 2:30 Sunday afternoon, his niece in Austin called to congratulate him. That was followed by an avalanche of e-mails from other family members expressing the same sentiments. "Prizes like the one Mr. Russell won are what keep Cash Five's loyal players in the game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "A $21,000 prize is significant, and serves as a reminder that Cash Five is fun to play and fun to win." Russell purchased his Quick Pick ticket at the Red Rock General Store and Feed on 106 Lentz/Main. His was one of two tickets that matched Saturday's winning numbers: 23-22-5-24-14. The other ticket was sold in El Paso at the Viscount Big 8, 9480 Viscount. Both retailers are eligible to receive a bonus of $212.19 for selling top-prize winning tickets. Russell told Lottery officials he was going to use part of his prize to buy a pressure washer to clean his farm implements. He

also plans to add his winnings to his "building fund" for his home on his 25 acres in Red Rock. "The thing to remember is that it's always better to be a participant than to sit in the audience," he said. "Some people say that you have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than of winning a lottery prize, but I say you can't win if you don't play." Russell said he has won several $50 prizes, one $115 prize for matching four numbers playing Lotto TexasTM and $300 on the Scratch Off game, Jingle Bucks, the Lottery's first $10-dollar game.
