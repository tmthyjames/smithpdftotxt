"After I heard from the lottery, I immediately called him (Khawja)," Ali explained. "He didn't believe me, so I finally told him 'Call the lottery then.'

Today, Texas Lottery Commission Representative, Renè McCoy presented Khawja with a ceremonial check in celebration of the retailer's good fortune.
