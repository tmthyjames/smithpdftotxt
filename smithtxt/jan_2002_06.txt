Lotto Texas Jackpot Racks Up Another First; Two Winners, Same Numbers, All Birthdays
(Austin, January 11) - - This may be another first for the Texas Lottery's big-dollar game. Two Lotto Texas players selected the winning numbers based on important family birthdays for the same drawing and won. There is no record that this has ever happened with this game. The winning numbers, 21-3-5-28-29-7, were lucky for Elizabeth Jones of Houston, who came to Austin today to pick up her share of the prize for the November 17, 2001, drawing. Jones enjoys playing multi-draw, buying her Lotto tickets for 10 drawings at a time.

Elizabeth and Al Jones of Houston collect their Lotto Texas jackpot at the Texas Lottery Commission in Austin.

"The clerk runs my old tickets through the terminal every time I buy my new tickets," Jones said. "When I took in the batch that had the winner, the clerk said I had to come to Austin to collect my prize." Jones said she thought she had matched five numbers. She went home and pulled up the Texas Lottery website (www.txlottery.org) to get one of the biggest surprises of her life. "I called Al, my husband, told him we had more than five numbers, and he came home immediately," she said. "All he did was look at that ticket all night. Not me because I went to bed and got up at 4:45 a.m. the next morning like I do every day to go to work." Since learning of her good fortune, Jones has given notice at her job, Gugenheim Investments, a small restaurant-related business where she is the bookkeeper. "My last day is March 15," she said. "I gave three months notice, and it has been really hard even to think that I'm going to leave this job. I told my boss that this has been almost like getting a divorce." Jones and her husband plan to return to their native Missouri in a couple of years. They plan to build their dream home on farm property they already have. "When we first came to Houston, we planned to stay here five years," she said. "That was 20 years ago. We're ready to return home." Al Jones was as elated as his wife was over the win. "I knew I married Miss Right," he said. "I just didn't know her first name was 'Always.'" The ticket was purchased with an annuity and will give the winner $80,000 per year for 25 years. Jones received her first payment today, and will receive another on the anniversary of the win next November.
