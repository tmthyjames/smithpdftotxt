Texas Two Step Winner Takes His Top-Prize With Coffee
(Austin, January 11) - - Texas Lottery winners find out about winning a top-prize in all kinds of ways. Some look up the numbers on the lottery's official website, www.txlottery.org. Some watch the lottery drawings faithfully every night, or read the results in their local newspaper the following morning. Some, like Stone Murray of Plano, let their wives check the tickets the following morning over a cup of coffee.

Stone Murray of Plano reacts to his $200,000 Texas Two Step win.

"She made me get up and go get the Two Step ticket from on top of the dresser," said Murray. "She's normally the one to play Texas Two Step, however, I had to buy the ticket this time because she couldn't get to the store." Murray said one of the tasks from his "Honey-Do" list is to buy $5 worth of Lotto Texas tickets every week, and this week he had to purchase his wife's Texas Two Step tickets as well. He explained his wife, Betty, became extremely excited when she noticed he had matched all four numbers plus the bonus ball. "She kept asking me, 'What's it mean? What's it mean?'" What it meant was a $200,000 windfall. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased at C-Store #110, at 4040 Preston Road in Plano. The numbers drawn for the January 4th drawing were: 16-19-22-28 and the Bonus Ball was 07. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $2,000 for selling the sole, top-prize winning Texas Two Step ticket.
