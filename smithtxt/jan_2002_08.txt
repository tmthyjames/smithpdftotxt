Lottery Commission Considers Pick 3 Mid-Day Drawing
(Austin, January 8) - - Today, the Texas Lottery Commission authorized the initial step of adding the first ever day drawing to the Texas Lottery family of online games. The proposal for a Pick 3 mid-day drawing was approved for publication in the Texas Register, and will be available for public comment for a minimum of 30 days afterward. "Today is a preliminary step toward the Texas Lottery adding a Pick 3 mid-day drawing," said Linda Cloud, Texas Lottery Executive Director. "By adding the additional drawing, we'll produce multiple benefits for everyone. Our lottery retailers will benefit with increased traffic in their stores, which translates to increased sales. Our players will benefit with more chances to win with playing a game they love. The State of Texas benefits with increased revenue." Pick 3, the Texas Lottery's second online introduced in 1993, has consistently experienced an increase in sales every year since its inception. The following table shows sales totals from startup for each Fiscal Year (FY):
Year FY 93 FY 94 FY 95 FY 96 FY 97 FY 98 FY 99 FY 00 FY 01 TOTAL Sales Amount Startup on October 25 $133,242,909 $141,077,588 $145,217,209 $158,549,126 $180,259,546 $183,658,933 $195,192,187 $206,756,647 $1,343,954,145

Out of the 34 states, plus the District of Columbia, in the U.S. that participate in a Pick 3-style game, 12 of those also participate in a mid-day drawing. "We're projecting up to a six percent increase in total sales for each year," said Cloud. "That translates into approximately $4.6 million in added revenue for the state." There will be no changes to the way Pick 3 is currently played. Players will still select three numbers each from 0 to 9, with four choices for how they can play their 3-digit combination (Exact Order, Any Order, Exact/Any Order or Combo). Cost to play will remain as little as 50 cents for a single Exact or Any Order play, or as much as $360 on a Combo play where the numbers are played for twelve draws. If the Texas Lottery decides to adopt the rules after the public comment period, the new Pick 3 mid-day draw would begin in late spring 2002. There will be a public hearing to discuss the proposed rules on February 8, 2002, at lottery headquarters in Austin. Currently, Texas' Pick 3 sales lead all U.S. lotteries west of the Mississippi River.
