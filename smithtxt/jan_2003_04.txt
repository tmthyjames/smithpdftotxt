Weekly Grand Winner Claims Million Dollar Prize From Texas Lottery

Weekly Grand winners Mary and James Wilson of Beaumont.

(Austin, January 24) - The Wilson Family Revocable Trust today claimed the top prize from the popular Texas LotteryTM scratch-off game, Weekly Grand. The prize, $1,000 a week for 20 years, comes to a total of $1,040,000, before taxes, and was claimed by the grantor of the trust, James Wilson. A long-time scratch-off player from Beaumont, Wilson still has a hard time believing he really scratched off this winning ticket. "I've been playing scratch-offs since they came out, but I always thought I would never win anything this big," said Wilson. "But someone has to win, and I've proved that." On the way back from a deer hunting trip in Marble Falls last November with a few buddies, Wilson bought several Weekly Grand scratch-off tickets to give him something to do on the long ride home. "I scratched the second game ticket, and the only way I can describe it is disbelief," he explained. Wilson said it took another 10 miles down the road before his friend driving the truck believed Wilson was a winner. At that point, Wilson said he called his wife and his other buddies. "My buddies are practical jokers and had played a few jokes on me the night before, so I think they all thought I was the one playing the joke," he said. He bought his winning Weekly Grand ticket at Hollingsworth Corner, located at 9418 E. Hwy 71 in Spicewood. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. Wilson and his wife, Mary, will continue to work, but now look at the win as a way to be "a little bit more comfortable."

"I hope we can pay off debt, and although we just finished doing some remodeling on our home, I really would like to get a new home that's a little larger," said Wilson. "This definitely makes life easier looking down the road," he added.
