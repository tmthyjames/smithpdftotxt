Holiday Instant Games Boost Texas Lottery Ticket Sales
(Austin, January 14) - The Texas Lottery Commission's instant game sales averaged $45 million a week during the 2002 holiday season, climbing to a total of $275 million from November 24 - January 4. This represents a 19 percent increase over instant games sales during the same six-week period in 2001. Toni Smith, Director of Marketing, attributes this boost in sales to the success of four holiday games, including Holiday Million, the Texas Lottery'sTM first-ever $20 scratch-off ticket. "As of January 4, we've sold $54 million worth of Holiday Million tickets since the game started November 27," said Smith. "During the first week of January, Holiday Million accounted for about 15 percent of our instant ticket sales." Holiday Million features seven games that offered 24 ways to win up to $1 million. Five $1 million prizes were offered, as well as prizes of $20, $40, $70, $100, $200, $350, $500, and $5,000. As of January 8, there had been two million-dollar winners, with three top prize tickets still unclaimed. Other holiday scratch-off games were extremely popular, as well. As of January 4, the new $10 game, Home for the Holidays, was 85 percent sold, while the $5 game, Treasures Under the Tree, was 94 percent sold and the $1 game, Winner Wonderland, was 95 percent sold. The Texas Lottery is currently ranked number three in instant ticket sales among U.S. lotteries. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
