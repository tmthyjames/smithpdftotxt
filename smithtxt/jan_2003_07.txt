(Austin, January 14) - According to Robby Nolan of Kosse, yesterday started out a little dreary, however, by 11 a.m. Monday morning, it turned into a beautiful day after all. That's when Nolan found out he won $100,000, the top cash prize in the Texas Top 10 scratch-off game. "I can't believe it, but with this kind of money, I guess it's got to be real because I'm looking at the check right now," said Nolan. "I guess it's going to be a good day after all." Texas Top 10 offers players a chance to win cash prizes of $100,000, $10,000, $1,000, $500, $250, $100, $50, $20, $15 and $10. The cost to play is $10. Overall odds of winning any prize in Texas Top 10 are 1 in 2.46, including break-even prizes. Nolan said he buys the $5 and $10 scratch-off games, and always starts scratching from the bottom of the ticket and works his way up. "I saw a $10,000 prize on the first part of the ticket I scratched," Nolan explained. "I didn't even finish scratching the rest before I went back inside the store and asked the clerk to look at it for me. I finished scratching the rest of the ticket, and ended up with $100,000. "It's a real blessing, especially at the start of the new year," he said. "I'm going to pay off some bills, and share some with my family." Nolan purchased his top prize winning ticket at Tetco #1109, located at 402 S. Ellis Street in Groesbeck. Nolan told lottery officials he plans on surprising his fiancée with the news. "She may plan our wedding for this weekend," he said. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $32 million.
