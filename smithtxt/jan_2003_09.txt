Old Joke Turns Into Reality For Fredericksburg Texas Lottery Winner

(Austin, January 14) - She thought the old joke had been put to rest. All she ever heard growing up was, "Jimmie Buck drives a truck." Now Jimmie R. Buck of Fredericksburg gets to laugh along with her friends: She will become the proud owner of a 2003 Ford F-150 SuperCab XLT pickup truck. She also holds the distinction of becoming the first truck winner in the Texas Lottery's? re-issued instant ticket, Bucks 'N Trucks II. "Now all my friends are saying it again," she laughed. "This time though, it's true." Buck's husband, Mike, had given her two tickets to make up for a disagreement. "My son and husband were in the store together, and our son told him that he should buy me that ticket," she said. "I guess it is fitting." To play the game, players scratch the ticket and look for a match between the number under YOUR NUMBERS and either LUCKY NUMBER. To win the truck, one of the numbers under YOUR NUMBERS must have a truck symbol and match either of the LUCKY NUMBERS. The game also gives players a chance to win a top cash prize of $1,000. The cost to play Bucks 'N Trucks II is $2. The odds of winning either a truck prize or any cash prize are 1 in 4.74, including break-even prizes. Buck explained how she realized one of the tickets was a top-prize winning one. "I always scratch the numbers that are mine first, then the ones that I need to match. I wait until I find a match before I scratch what the prize will be," Buck said. "That way, if there's no match, I don't know what any of the prizes were." Players must claim their truck prize at one of the 22 Texas Lottery Claim Centers throughout the state. Cash prizes under $599 may be redeemed instantly at any Texas Lottery retailer. Cash prizes over $600, and less than $1 million may be claimed at any one of the Lottery's Claim Centers or by mail using a claim form. Claim forms are available at the claim centers, in a downloadable format from the Texas Lottery Commission's official website (www.txlottery.org) or by visiting a Lottery retailer.
