Loyal Brownsville Lotto Texas Player Claims $12 Million Jackpot
(Austin, January 9) - While the "eyes of Texas" are watching for the person who bought a Lotto TexasTM ticket for the July 13, 2002 drawing to come forward before the ticket expires tonight at midnight, a Brownsville man wasted no time in claiming his $12 million jackpot from a drawing just last month. Today, Jose Luis Betancourt claimed the jackpot for the December 11, 2002 Lotto Texas drawing. He chose the Cash Value Option, and will receive $7,508,809 before taxes. He said he plans to seek advice from financial professionals before making any firm decisions on what to do with his good fortune. Betancourt credits his win to being a regular Lotto Texas player and playing the same numbers in 15 different sequences for more than a year now. "I know that matching five numbers is difficult, so when I matched six numbers, I knew it was truly a miracle," said Betancourt. Betancourt said he routinely checks his ticket numbers in the El Nuevo Heraldo, which is the Spanish edition of The Brownsville Herald newspaper. That's how he found out his numbers matched all six numbers drawn: 5-16-28-35-46-51. "When I checked the El Nuevo Heraldo and realized I had won, I thought it was a wonderful experience, and then I felt very tranquil," he explained. So wonderful that Betancourt says he will continue to play Lotto Texas, and his message for other players is, "S?, se puede - it can be done." And he made this observation about the person who may have let a jackpot slip away. "Too bad, this is why we play," said Betancourt. "If you don't buy the tickets, you can't win. When you win, you've got to claim it!" Betancourt purchased his ticket from Tejano Mart #408 at 834 North Expressway 77/83 in Brownsville. The retailer is eligible to receive a 1 percent bonus - $120,000 - for selling the prize-winning ticket. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $25 million. ....
