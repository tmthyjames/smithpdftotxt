Time Running Out For Lotto Texas Ticket Deadline For $9 Million Ticket Is Thursday, January 9
(Austin, January 8) - With less than two days left to claim a LOTTO TEXASTM ticket worth $9 million, Texas Lottery Commission Acting Executive Director Gary Grief announced he is activating a special "Countdown Processing Team" in the hopes the player will show up at lottery headquarters in Austin by the deadline. "We're activating our Countdown Processing Team now to be on hand to meet the player who brings us the correct 6-of-6 matching ticket," said Grief. "We're really hoping that this time our outreach efforts will be successful and the person who holds that ticket will come forward. "The ticket must be presented at Lottery headquarters in Austin by midnight on January 9," he added. While the identity of who has the ticket is still unknown, lottery officials said they know this much about the ticket: * The ticket was a Quick Pick * The player chose the Cash Value Option, which will payout more than $5.1 million, before taxes * It was purchased at the 7-Eleven store, located at 3329 Oak Lawn Avenue in Dallas. * The winning numbers drawn were: 29-42-22-08-11-05. "If you live in the Dallas area, check your old tickets. If you have friends, family or business associates that were here during that time, and they may have bought Lotto Texas tickets, tell them to look, too," Grief suggested. "The final days are quickly approaching to claim this $9 million jackpot prize." If the ticket is not turned in before the deadline, the money goes to help the state pay for indigent healthcare. Since September 1, 1999, the first $40 million in unclaimed prize money in each biennium is transferred to the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account, which helps support the teaching programs and indigent health care at UTMB-Galveston. Any amount over the $40 million is transferred to the Tertiary Care Facility Account, which funds indigent healthcare at medical facilities throughout the state. To date, there have been two LOTTO TEXAS jackpots to go unclaimed. The first was from the October 26, 1994, drawing. A ticket, worth $12.4 million, was sold in Flower Mound and was not claimed by April 25, 1995, the 180-day deadline. The second ticket, for a jackpot worth an estimated $13 million, was sold in Humble for the June 23, 2001, LOTTO TEXAS drawing. The ticket expired on December 20, 2001, and $7.3 million, the Cash Value Option selected by the ticketbuyer, went to the Multicategorical Teaching Hospital Account. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
