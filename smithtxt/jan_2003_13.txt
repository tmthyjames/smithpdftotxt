Stop For Ice Heats Up New Year For Second Winner In Million-Dollar Texas Lottery Scratch-Off Game
(Austin, January 6) - Running an after-work errand to pick up ice, Jody Herrington of Santa Fe, Texas, also picked up a cool million dollars as the second winner in the Holiday Million scratch-off game from the Texas LotteryTM. "It was New Year's Eve and I called my wife to see if she needed me to pick up anything for our get-together that night," explained Herrington. Herrington had his three bags of ice and decided to purchase a $20 Holiday Million ticket when he spotted it among the other game tickets at the Time Out convenience store counter. "I went out to the truck and scratched it right then," he said. "When I realized I had possibly won the $1 million, I started driving home, turning the wrong way, only thinking I had to show it to my wife, Sheila. "She thought someone was playing a joke, because there was no way something like this could happen to us," he said. "But, once we realized it was true, we had a great New Year's Eve celebration." Herrington said he wants to start 2003 debt-free. The retailer that sold the winning ticket, Time Out at 13405 Highway 6, Santa Fe, Texas, is eligible to receive a commission of $10,000. The Holiday Million game ticket has seven games that offer 24 ways to win up to $1 million. Five $1 million prizes are offered in this game, as well as prizes of $20, $40, $70, $100, $200, $350, $500, and $5,000. Herrington's win marks the second $1 million Holiday Million ticket claimed. The first winner cashed in his ticket on Friday, January 3. Holiday Million, the Texas Lottery's first $20 scratch-off ticket, was one of four seasonal games that helped boost instant ticket sales.
