Loyal Texas LotteryTM Scratch-Off Player Wins First $1 Million In New Holiday Game
(Austin, January 3) - It was a very merry Christmas for one loyal Texas Lottery scratch-off player who decided to try something new. Johnny Johnson, a 48-year-old Fort Worth School District employee, purchased two Holiday Million scratch-off tickets, the Texas Lottery's first $20 scratch-off game, and wound up increasing his $40 investment to $1 million. "I was heading home from work to put up some last-minute Christmas decorations, and I decided to stop at a little store about three or four blocks from the shop," explained Johnson. Johnson had already played the new game in the prior week with a coworker and had won as much as $100 several times. "I'm not a fast 'scratcher,' because I don't want to miss a scratch. Well, I went really slow," he said. Johnson matched a million dollar symbol and in disbelief went back into the store to have the clerk scan the ticket. "When the clerk said the cash-in limit was exceeded and the computer couldn't validate the ticket, I knew something was happening," he said. "When I called the Lottery, they said 'Congratulations' and that was enough for me." Johnson said he has been continuously reminded by Eva, his wife of 21 years, to be smart and stay levelheaded, advice he has taken to task by seeking tax and investment assistance from a respected uncle. "The first thing I want to do is tithe to my church because I thanked God for all the blessings I had even before the win," he said. "Secondly, we want to become debt-free and take care of a few personal pleasures, like maybe a new car for my wife. And finally, I want to try to see who we can help in our immediate families before sitting down with an investment team," Johnson explained. The Fort Worth retailer that sold the winning ticket, K & H Food Store at 809 W. Northside Drive, is eligible to receive a commission of $10,000. Holiday Million made its debut on November 27 and as of December 28, 2002, the Texas Lottery's first $20 scratch-off game has already sold 46 per cent of the 5 million tickets printed. "All of the holiday scratch-off games have been extremely popular," said Stephanie Goertz, Instant Product Manager for the Texas Lottery Commission. "As of December 28, 2002, the new $10 game, Home for the Holidays, is 82 per cent sold, while the $5 game Treasures Under The Tree is 93 per cent sold and the $1 game Winner Wonderland is 92 per cent sold." Other lucky tickets are out there. One individual with the second winning ticket has also contacted the Lottery and has begun the validation process. Lottery officials say there are three more million dollars tickets in the game. Instant game ticket sales generate the highest revenue for the Texas Lottery with $1.9 billion in tickets sold in Fiscal Year 2002, a 12.5 per cent increase over Fiscal Year 2001. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth $15 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A
