Roanoke Man Adds "Mega MillionsTM MegaplierTM Winner" To List Of Life Accomplishments

"I went in there thinking I'd won $5, 000," said Gosney. "When they told me I'd won $15,000, I said, 'That's alright!' Now I'll have to tell my wife because she was pretty excited when she thought it was $5,000."

(Austin, January 29) - Talk to George Gosney for any length of time and this "ole military man," as he calls himself, will bend your ear on all he's done in his 70-some-odd years of living. He is proud to tell you that he served in the army for 20 years and is a veteran of Vietnam and Korea. He also taught in public schools for 31 years and raised six boys who still live "within borrowing distance" of his Denton County home. That last phrase takes on a new meaning now that the Roanoke man can also say he's a "Mega MillionsTM MegaplierTM winner." Gosney's Quick Pick ticket for the newest Texas Lottery® game was one of four that matched 4-of-5 numbers and the Mega Ball for the drawing on Tuesday, January 27. That prize level is $5,000, but since Gosney paid an extra dollar when he bought that ticket at the Kroger on Keller Parkway in Keller, that amount is "megaplied" by three, the Megaplier number selected for that drawing. Gosney said he was delighted when he learned that he'd actually won $15,000 when he went to the Fort Worth Claim Center with his ticket. "I went in there thinking I'd won $5, 000," said Gosney. "When they told me I'd won $15,000, I said, 'That's alright!' Now I'll have to tell my wife because she was pretty excited when she thought it was $5,000." When Gosney showed the bigger check to Dora, his wife of "just 48 years," she told him that she didn't mind any more if he played the Lottery. "Lottery players in Texas are the only ones who can choose to "megaply" when they play Mega Millions," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "Mr. Gosney's win shows just how much fun it can be to win a non-grand/jackpot prize with the "Megaplier" in play." Gosney said he plans to put part of his winnings towards the new car that he bought recently, save some, and then just spend the rest on "good things."

He also plans to continue playing Mega Millions with the Megaplier, saying that's the only way he plays. And he'll encourage others to play by bragging about his newest title, which he's shortened to "Lottery Winner." After all, "Mega Millions Megaplier Winner" is a bit of a mouthful, even for a talker like him. The numbers drawn in the Mega Millions game on January 27 were: 6-10-20-38-50 and the Mega Ball, 27. Gosney's ticket matched 6-10-38-50 and the Mega Ball. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at www.txlottery. org.
