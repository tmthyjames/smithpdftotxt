Winning $1 Million Can Be Soooo Sweet

Ruth Titus holds her ceremonial $1,000,000 check given by Texas Lottery On Line Product Manager, Robert Tirloni.

(Austin, January 26) - Ruth Titus said she had to run to the store to buy sugar for her morning coffee. While at the counter, she decided to try her luck at a Texas Lottery® scratch off game she had never played before. "I usually play Crossword and Bingo," Titus said. "I just decided to try something new. So I bought three of the $1,000,000 Classic scratch off tickets. I went back home and started the coffee brewing and scratched my tickets at the same time." The Dallas/Oak Cliff resident says she finished scratching the first ticket and won $20. She scratched the second one, and won $20 again. "That third one was it though," she explained. "I was in shock. Then I started hollerin' and yellin'." Titus' daughter and son were at the house with her when she found out she was holding a top-prize winning $1,000,000 Classic instant ticket. "It never hurts to try something new every once in a while," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "And winning a million dollars certainly makes the trying, worth it." Titus' shock has worn off enough to let lottery officials know what kind of plans she's made with her winnings.

"I'm paying off the house I live in now, and letting my daughter live in it. I'm buying me a new home and truck. Then I'm going on a vacation to Jamaica," she said. Titus also said she plans to keep working at her Borden Milk Company job of three years. "I told people at work about my winning ticket. Some said they didn't believe me, and others congratulated me." She purchased her ticket at Overton Stop & Save Food Store, located at 1406 E. Overton Road in Dallas. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. To date, there is still one top prize $1,000,000 Classic ticket that has not been claimed. Other cash prizes for the game include: $5,000, $500, $350, $200, $100, $70, $40, and $20. Each ticket is $20.
