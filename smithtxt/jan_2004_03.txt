Hula Time For $400,000 Texas Two Step® Winner
(Austin, January 23) - Khon C. Tran of Austin is taking his family for a vacation to Hawaii later this year. He'll pay for it with some of the $400,000 he won playing the Texas Two Step® game from the Texas Lottery®. "Luaus, pristine beaches and palm trees, that's the little bit of heaven Mr. Tran is going to buy for his family with his Texas Two Step® prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "What a fun thing to do with a prize like this." An avid fan of Texas Two Step, Tran came to the Austin Claim Center today to claim his prize. He told lottery officials that he liked the size of the jackpot for last Tuesday night's drawing and bought $20-worth of Quick Pick tickets. "I really like Texas Two Step, you have better chances to win," he said. "The other game I play is Cash FiveTM, because I won $1,000 a few years ago. In fact, that was the only prize I'd won before today." Tran was in his office at a local restaurant when he read the numbers in the Austin American-Statesman. "I read them over and over and finally I called my wife so she could check, too," he said. "She told me I really was seeing the numbers in the paper that were on my ticket, too." A trip to Hawaii isn't the only immediate purchase Tran will make. He has his eyes on another item. "We're probably going to get a new car very soon because we need it," he said. "We have three small children, ages one, three and five." The jackpot for tonight's Texas Two Step drawing is at its $200,000 starting point and the Mega MillionsTM jackpot for tonight is worth an estimated $51 million. The jackpot for Saturday's Lotto TexasTM drawing is an estimated $60 million, which is still the largest lottery jackpot in the country.
