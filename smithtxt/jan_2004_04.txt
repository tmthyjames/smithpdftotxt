Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Still The Highest In Nation At $55 Million
(Austin, January 21) - For the second week running, Texas' own big jackpot game, Lotto TexasTM, is offering the largest jackpot in the United States. Mega MillionsTM, another jackpot game offered by the Texas Lottery® and ten other states, is second in the nation, with a jackpot of $51 million for Friday night's drawing. "People may get tired of hearing it, but everything really is bigger in Texas," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "We're very excited to be able to offer Texas players a chance to play for the Number 1 and Number 2 jackpots in the country." Greer reported that Mega Millions sales continue to have the expected impact on Lotto Texas. "Initial projections were that Lotto sales could decline by up to 21 percent with the addition of Mega Millions to our product line-up," said Greer. "Those projections are in-line with what we're seeing, but Lotto has a loyal player base, and certainly having a jackpot this size helps Lotto's bottom line." While no one has won the big jackpot games in Texas recently, Texas players have done well at other games and prize levels. Texas Two Step®, a game with jackpots that start at $200,000, just had a winner of its $400,000 jackpot from Tuesday night. The Quick Pick ticket was sold in Austin at TETCO 56 on 8600 U.S. 290 East. The person with the ticket that matches all four numbers and the Bonus Ball has 180 days to bring the ticket to Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin and claim the prize. Twelve Texas players have won the second tier prize in Mega Millions, since tickets for that game went on sale in Texas December 1. The second tier prize is worth $175,000 in the ten other states offering Mega Millions. However, Texas players can choose to play an add-on feature of the game called the MegaplierTM. By paying an extra dollar, those players can MegaplyTM their non-jackpot prizes by two, three or four times. Three of the 12 second tier prize-winners "megaplied" their purchase - for two players, the $175,000 prize became $700,000 the night the number "4" was chosen as the Megaplier. The other winner doubled their prize to $350,000 when the Megaplier was a "2". As of today, the top 5 jackpots in the United States are:
