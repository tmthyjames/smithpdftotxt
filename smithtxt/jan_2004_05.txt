Weekly GrandTM Winner Set For Retirement ­ But Still Planning To Keep Working

Winner Theresa "Terry" Ballew and Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission.

(Austin, January 16) - Rodney Ballew likes to buy Weekly GrandTM tickets from the Texas Lottery® because he thought that $1,000 a week would help him and his wife, Theresa, in their retirement. Ballew said that he also likes to "scratch" the ticket a particular way, uncovering the prizes first. He didn't get too excited when he saw "GRAND" on the ticket he bought for his wife, thinking the $40 wasn't a bad prize. But when he learned that her prize was $1,000 a week for twenty years, he was pretty happy that he bought that ticket. Theresa "Terry" Ballew of Godly, Texas, south of Fort Worth, claimed the top-prize today at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin, a GRAND total of $1,040,000, before taxes. She had time to catch her breath after her husband told her he had a winning ticket for her, and she plans to keep working at her job at a doctor's office. "My boss did a double-take when I showed him the ticket," Terry Ballew said. "At first he just said, 'That's nice' but then he came back and said, 'That's more than a million dollars! You're not quitting, are you?' I told him I wasn't planning on leaving." Terry Ballew wants to continue work on her degree and fulfill her dream of being a teacher. There's also one more thing she needs to do: "I have another winning Weekly Grand ticket to cash," she said. "That one's for $2." The winning ticket was bought at Park N Shop on 1200 North Main Street in Cleburne. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of $10,000 for selling a top-prize ticket. Weekly Grand was first issued in May of 1995. Re-issued 11 times, it has been one of the most popular games ever offered by
