One For The Record Books: Lottery Transfers To State Exceed $11 Billion
(Austin, January 15) - The Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission announced a new milestone for the agency today: revenues generated by the Texas Lottery® for the State of Texas have exceeded the $11 billion mark. "I'm proud to announce that with today's transfer to the Texas Treasury, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $11 billion for Texas since the Games of Texas began in 1992," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "More than $5.9 billion of that has gone to the Foundation School Fund, which helps pay for public education in Texas." The total to date is $11,081,538,698. For the first five years of operations, Texas Lottery revenues were directed to the General Revenue Fund and account for more than $4.9 billion of the total. During the 1997 legislative session, the Legislature voted to dedicate lottery revenues to the Foundation School Fund, and since Fiscal Year 98, revenues from sales of lottery tickets have benefited public education. In addition to revenues from sales, the State of Texas also receives money from any unclaimed lottery prizes. That category accounts for more than $221.9 million of the total, and has been used by the State to provide funding for a number of programs, such as teaching hospitals and indigent healthcare. "This is a milestone for all of us here at the Texas Lottery Commission and we're proud of the results of our efforts," said Greer. "On behalf of the entire staff, I'd like to thank our legislators, retailers and players who've helped make this accomplishment possible." The Texas Lottery began generating revenue for the State of Texas in 1992, initially as a division within the Comptroller of Public Accounts. Its operations moved under the auspices of the Texas Lottery Commission when the agency was created in September 1993. The Commission is also responsible for the regulation of charitable bingo.
