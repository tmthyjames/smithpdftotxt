Player Wins, Tours Mexico, Returns And Collects $10,000 Mega MillionsTM Prize
(Austin, January 8) - San Antonio resident Eddie Rosales made sure to buy a Mega MillionsTM for the drawing the day after Christmas. He picked his numbers, bought his ticket, found out he won $10,000, and then left Texas on a previously-planned bus tour to Mexico. When he returned, he claimed his Megaplied prize. "The numbers came to me, I just pulled them out of my head," he said. "Then, Saturday morning, I went to the Diamond Shamrock nearby to get a printout of the winning numbers and there were five of my numbers. I showed it to my wife and she wouldn't believe it." Right after, Rosales and his wife left on a bus tour. They traveled to the jewel of Mexican colonial cities, San Miguel de Allende, in the state of Guanajuato. "What a great way to travel - you win some money playing Mega Millions before you leave and then come home to collect it," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "You almost don't mind if your vacation ends, no matter how great it is." Getting home, however, was another story according to the Rosales. It wasn't that Mr. and Mrs. Rosales couldn't come back, it just took a while. "We waited 14 hours trying to cross from Nuevo Laredo into Laredo," he said. "That was unbelievable." Rosales says he and his wife have no immediate plans for their winnings, but are looking to the future and a trip west. "We're part of a group that travels together, and we're probably going to Las Vegas later this year," he said. The Big Diamond #1006, 2250 Bandera Road in San Antonio, sold the ticket that won Mr. Rosales $5,000. Because Rosales paid an extra dollar to play the MegaplierTM feature, he doubled his winnings to $10,000 when a "2" was selected as the Megaplier. Rosales matched four numbers and the Mega Ball to win his prize. The winning numbers for the December 26 Mega Millions drawing were 29-20-10-17-2, and the Mega Ball was 36. The jackpot for Friday's Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $20 million. Tonight's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is an estimated $43 million.
