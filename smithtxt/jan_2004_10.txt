Retaining Wall Will Hold Up Well, Thanks To Overhaul Bought With $21,928 Cash FiveTM Prize

Margaret Bizzell of Trinidad says, "Our retaining wall really needs work . . . I'm going to start taking bids next week."

(Austin, January 6) - Margaret Bizzell of Trinidad knew immediately what she was going to buy with the $21,928 prize she won in the December 31 Cash FiveTM drawing. "We live on Cedar Creek Lake and our retaining wall really needs work," she said. "My husband and I have been talking about doing this, and now we have the money to do it now. I'm going to start taking bids next week." "It's always great to help our players get it done, whatever 'it' may be," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We're happy to have had a hand in giving the Bizzells the peace of mind that will come from fixing their retaining wall." Bizzell said she found out she'd won when she read her numbers in the paper. Those numbers were 12-27-20-21-31. "I check my numbers every day in The Dallas Morning News," she said. "As I read the numbers, I told my husband, 'Hey, we matched two, no, three, oh, it's four, oh no, we got them all.' And even though you play and want to win, you don't expect to, so it's a great surprise when you do." Bizzell bought her Quick Pick ticket at Scottie's Convenience Store, located Highway 274 and FM 85 in Seven Points. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent of the top prize, which comes to $219.28. The jackpot for Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM drawing is worth an estimated $12 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is an estimated $43 million.
