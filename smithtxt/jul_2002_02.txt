Port Arthur Lotto Winner Says "Let The Good Times Roll"

Lee and Frances Soileau talk about winning the lottery with Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud.

(Austin, July 26) - Frances Soileau and her husband, Lee, learned Thursday morning that her Lotto Texas ticket for the Wednesday, July 24, drawing was a perfect 6-of-6 match for the $6 million jackpot. Now, according to the couple, they plan on letting the good times roll. "I haven't gotten as excited as I probably will later on," Soileau said. "I know we've won, and I'm just tickled about it." Soileau and her husband, both retired, were sitting in their kitchen on Thursday morning, reading the paper when they found out they had matched all six numbers. "I usually look at the Lotto numbers the morning after a drawing in one of two papers," Soileau said. "We get the Port Arthur News and the Beaumont Enterprise. After I saw the first six numbers on my ticket matched the ones in the papers, I handed it over to Lee and said, 'Look what we've done.' "That's when we knew," she said. "We've been playing since the Lotto started. I used to always think we would win someday." The couple, married for 12 years, met after one of Frances' friends moved to the Port Arthur area, and Frances went to visit her. "He (Lee) lived next door to my friend, and came over when he saw I was over there to visit," she explained. "He told me my friend wasn't home, and I explained to him, 'It doesn't matter, I have a key to get in.' When my friend got home, she found us sitting in her kitchen." Lee Soileau, an U.S. Army veteran from World War II, was captured the week of Thanksgiving in 1944 by German forces and kept as a prisoner of war for six months. "I escaped them and then got captured by the Russians," he told officials. "They thought I was a German spy, but then found out I was an American. They gave me a compass and let me go. When I finally found more Americans, I only weighed 87 pounds."

The two told lottery officials they haven't had an opportunity to make any definite plans yet with the lottery win, but Soileau plans on doing at least one thing. "I'm splitting it with my husband," she said. "We may get a new automobile, too." Soileau chose the Cash Value Option on her Quick Pick ticket, and will receive $3,463,036.80, before taxes are withheld. She makes the first ever Port Arthur resident to win a Lotto Texas jackpot prize. The jackpot-winning ticket was purchased at Fisco Convenience Store, located at 2539 Jefferson Drive in Port Arthur. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the jackpot amount, $60,000. The winning numbers were: 47 - 06 - 25 - 50 - 02 - 54 "It feels amazing," said Soileau. "I don't feel any different," her husband, Lee, added. "It won't change anything." Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. --------------Note To TV Editors: There will be a satellite feed of today's winner check presentation available from 2:30 p.m. to 2:45 p.m., Central Standard Time.
