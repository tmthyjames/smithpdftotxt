New Cash Five Game Starts On Sunday, July 28th
(Austin, July 25) - Sales for the Texas Lottery's newest game - CASH FIVE - begin on Sunday, July 28. The first drawing for the revamped game will be held on Monday, July 29, at 10:12 p.m., and every night thereafter except Sundays. "The new CASH FIVE game change offers players a greater chance of winning," said Robert Tirloni, On-line Product Manager of the Texas Lottery Commission. "The new overall odds of winning are just 1-in-8 compared to 1-in-100 for the old game." Players will choose five numbers from one to 37, and can win prizes for matching two, three, four or five numbers. Players can win a guaranteed cash prize of $2 for matching only two numbers. All prizes are pari-mutuel except the guaranteed $2 prize. The cost to play CASH FIVE will continue to be $1. "The Texas Lottery is projecting a 10-percent increase in sales with the new CASH FIVE changes," said Tirloni. "That means approximately $4 - $5 million in additional revenue for the state." While the old game produced approximately 5,000 to 6,000 winners per drawing, the new game is projected to produce approximately 50,000 to 60,000 winners per drawing. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. --------Note to TV Editors: A Video News Release (VNR) of the CASH FIVE changes will be available during our nightly satellite feed starting at 10:05 p.m. The VNR will be available tonight and Friday, July 26.
