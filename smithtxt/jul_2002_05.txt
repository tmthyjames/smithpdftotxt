(Austin, July 11) - Jimmie Boyd, Jr. of Longview had big plans for today, and a cantankerous bank vault holding his jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket wasn't about to make him change them. Boyd was the first claimant to come to Texas Lottery headquarters after the Lotto Texas jackpot was hit from the Saturday, June 22, drawing. Today, he became the fifth and final winner to collect his share, $8,502,425, of the $74 million jackpot prize. "I went to the bank yesterday to get my ticket out of the safety deposit box, and the bank vault door wouldn't open because there was a problem with the timer," explained Boyd. "My daughter got a hold of the bank president and he told her, 'We'll get somebody over there right away to get it open for you.'" "I told the girl there, 'I have to get that ticket today because I'm on my to Austin,' he added. He says he has different plans for this weekend. "I have a fishing pole I got at Christmas that I haven't used yet," Boyd said. "I think I may go and get it wet this week." Besides fishing, Boyd told lottery officials he has also made a few other plans on how he's going to spend his jackpot prize. "I got a brand new white Nissan Supercab pickup truck that I love, my wife and I are going to build a new home, and I'm going to spend money on my four children, 12 grandchildren and two great grandchildren," he said. Boyd purchased his winning Quick Pick set of numbers at the Stop & Shop, located at 5003 Estes Parkway in Longview. The retailer is eligible to receive $100,000 for selling one of the five top-prize winning tickets for the Lotto jackpot. "I went to the store pretty soon after I realized I had a winning ticket, and the guy who sold it to me figured I was the one," Boyd said. "He kept asking me what my name was, but I never told him. I went to the Dairy Queen too, and the girl behind the counter said she knew the name of the winner. She didn't even realize she was talking to me." Boyd makes the first Longview resident to win a Lotto Texas jackpot prize. Each of the winning tickets was purchased with the Cash Value Option, and each winner received $8.5 million. The five winning tickets were purchased in Sherman, Longview, Terrell, Pearland and Austin. Chester Brown of Sherman claimed his share on June 26, Shawn Pitts of Austin came to headquarters on June 28, James Quinton of Pearland received his share on July 2, and Judy Holmes of Arcadia, Louisiana, claimed the Terrell ticket on July 3. The winning numbers were: 16 - 11 - 02 - 13 - 34 - 26. "I'm truly blessed," Boyd said. "I'm just going to go on with my life." The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth $9 million. ....
