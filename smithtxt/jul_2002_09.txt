Recent $70 Million Jackpot Leads To Record Overall June Sales
(Austin, July 3) - Last month's estimated $70 million Lotto Texas jackpot drove ticket sales up and set a new record for the Texas Lottery's June sales. "That jackpot ­ the third highest ever won by our players - helped break our old record for June sales," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud. "In June 2002, we sold more than $297.3 million worth of tickets for all our games, breaking the previous high of $276.3 million set in June 1997, and making this the best June in our ten year history." Cloud noted that "Lotto Fever" also set a new weekly record. Total Lottery sales for all games for the week before the June 22nd drawing were $99.7 million, the third highest week in the Lottery's history. When no ticket matched all six numbers for the advertised $50 million jackpot on Wednesday, June 19th, the Texas Lottery announced its first estimate for the Saturday drawing at $68 million. Continued player enthusiasm increased sales and the Lottery bumped the jackpot to $70 million. When the final sales were in, the jackpot prize was worth $74,226,172. Five tickets matched all six numbers, giving each of the winners who selected the Cash Value Option, more than $8.5 million each. As of Wednesday, four of the five winners have claimed their share of the jackpot. The outstanding ticket is the one purchased in Longview. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $9 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
