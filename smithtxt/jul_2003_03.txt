Time Runs Out For Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Prize Second To Go Unclaimed This Year
(Austin, July 29) - The proverbial clock has stopped ticking for a Lotto Texas jackpot worth $5 million to be claimed. The 180day deadline for the ticket holder to step forward expired yesterday at midnight. It is the second Lotto Texas jackpot prize to go unclaimed this year. The Texas Lottery Commission had activated its "Countdown Processing Team" and was waiting at Austin headquarters in case anyone showed up with the ticket before the deadline. The ticket was purchased for the drawing held on January 29, and the six numbers to match were: 37-04-12-33-52-22. Whoever bought the ticket chose the Cash Value Option, making the ticket worth more than $3 million, before taxes. The winning ticket was purchased at the Diamond Shamrock Corner Store, located at 1002 Castroville Road in San Antonio. The retail owner received a bonus of 1 percent - $50,000 - for selling the winning Lotto Texas ticket. The ticket now earns its place in Texas Lottery® history as the fourth Lotto Texas jackpot ticket to go unclaimed in the game's 10-year history. The first was from the October 26, 1994, drawing. That ticket, worth $12.4 million, was sold in Flower Mound and was not claimed by April 25, 1995. The second ticket, for a jackpot worth an estimated $13 million, was sold in Humble for the June 23, 2001, Lotto Texas drawing. The ticket expired on December 20, 2001, with a Cash Value Option of $7.3 million. The most recent jackpot ticket to go unclaimed was purchased in Dallas for the July 13, 2002, drawing worth $9 million. The deadline passed on January 9, 2003, with no word from a ticket holder, who would have taken home more than $5.1 million, before taxes were withheld. Since the jackpot was not claimed, the value of the January 29 ticket, $3,015,708, will be transferred to the Tertiary Care Facility Account, which funds indigent healthcare at medical facilities throughout the state. The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $47 million.
