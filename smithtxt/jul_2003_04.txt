Texas Lottery® Cash FiveTM Game - One Year And 17,747,653 Total Winners Later
(Austin, July 29) - The Texas Lottery® is celebrating the one year anniversary of the Cash FiveTM game. Since the game was revamped in 2002, more than 17 million tickets have matched numbers giving players prizes totaling $70,830,620. "The Cash Five game is stronger than ever," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "We have a game that is extremely popular with our players, has great odds of winning, and shows an increase in sales of more than 22 percent since we re-launched it last year." The increase in sales reflects the 45 weeks after the re-launch in July 2002, compared with the same period prior to the game change. The Cash Five game, in which players choose five numbers from 1 to 37, offers players 1 in 8 odds of winning any prize. Players win cash prizes for matching two, three, four and five numbers. If players match two numbers, they win a guaranteed prize of $2. All other cash prizes are pari-mutuel. Drawings are held Monday through Saturday at 10:12 p.m., Central Standard Time. "Cash Five produces an average of 50,000 winners per drawing," said Greer. "That's a big reason our players and retailers like it so much, and between August 3 and 16, players will receive a free Cash Five Quick Pick with a $5 or more Cash Five purchase." The free ticket will be good for the current Cash Five drawing. The promotion ends on Saturday, August 16 at midnight.
