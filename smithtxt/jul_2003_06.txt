Mystery Texas Two Step® Winner Claims Jackpot With Ticket Sold In Clute
(Austin, July 25) - It's been the talk of this small Texas town since the drawing on June 6. Someone who bought a Texas Two Step ticket at the Kroger's in Clute, Texas, population 8,910, won a $1.1 million jackpot. The answer to: "Who is it?" came today, when James Scott Scruggs of Lake Jackson came to Lottery headquarters in Austin to claim the prize. Scruggs will receive a check for $825,000, after taxes. The winner knows there's been a lot of talk about the big prize in the small town, but he's kept a low profile. "I'm a very private person," said Scruggs. "I am sharing the excitement of this with my family." Scruggs' ticket was a Quick Pick and was the only one that matched all four numbers plus the Bonus Ball for the drawing on Friday, June 6. The winning numbers were: 13 - 22 - 26 ­ 33, with the Bonus Ball number 25. The ticket was purchased at Kroger #109 on 101 Dixie Drive in Clute. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. "Our winners come from all over Texas, small towns and big cities," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "We offer Mr. Scruggs our congratulations, and thank him for playing the 'Games of Texas.' " The little town of Clute has another big Texas Lottery winner. The Andrew C. and Rita G. LaSalle 1996 Family Trust won a $32.4 million jackpot for the Lotto TexasTM drawing on October 12, 1996. The trust receives more than $1.6 million every year for the ticket that was purchased at Salyer's Short Stop in Clute. Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $200,000. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $41 million.
