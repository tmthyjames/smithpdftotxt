Clock Ticking Down For Unclaimed Lotto TexasTM Jackpot ... New Record Could Be Set

Texas Lottery Executive Director Reagan E. Greer speaks to reporters about missing Lotto Texas jackpot ticket.

(San Antonio, July 21) - Today, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer announced that almost no time remains for someone to come forward and claim the $5 million jackpot from the January 29 Lotto TexasTM drawing. "Turning in that ticket before the deadline earns someone more than $3 million and a place in the Texas Lottery record books," said Greer. "The current record for claiming a Lotto Texas jackpot is 147 days. We're at 173 days and counting, so if that ticket shows up before next Monday at midnight, the jackpot and the record go to the winner." Greer held a news conference this morning at the Diamond Shamrock Corner Store at 1002 Castroville Road where the winning ticket was sold. Valero Energy Corporation, which owns the store, has already received its $50,000 bonus and shared a portion of it with the store's employees. Greer, a native and resident of San Antonio, said the story has a lot of San Antonio angles. "A previous San Antonio winner currently holds the record for taking the longest to claim a Lotto Texas prize," explained Greer. "Robert Wantland Family Investments, Ltd., claimed a $7.4 million jackpot prize on February 12, 1997. That was 147 days after the September 18, 1996, drawing." Greer noted that Robert Wantland came across the ticket unexpectedly, while rummaging through a desk drawer.
