(Austin, July 21) - Today, Maria Vera of San Antonio bumped into Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer at the Texas Lottery San Antonio Claim Center. In a ceremony usually conducted only in Austin for big jackpot winners, Greer presented Vera her check for winning the top cash prize for Cash FiveTM from the Saturday, July 19, drawing, worth $42,963. After taxes, Vera took home $32,222.25. "I got the chance to give someone a check today," said Greer. "We started the search for one winner by paying another one. I just hope that spurs the holder for our missing Lotto Texas jackpot ticket to come in soon." Greer was on his way to attend a news conference at the Diamond Shamrock Corner Store, located at 1002 Castroville Road. The retail location sold a jackpot winning Lotto TexasTM ticket for the drawing held on January 29. As of today, the ticket has remained unclaimed.
