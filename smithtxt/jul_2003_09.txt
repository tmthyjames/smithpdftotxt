Texas Lottery® On The Rise - Third In Nation With Total Lottery Sales
(Austin, July 18) - The stats are in, and the Texas Lottery® proves that game changes and enhancements made last year have paid off. A fiscal sales summary provided by La Fleur's 2003 World Lottery Almanac shows that of all 39 lotteries operating in United States, Texas ranks third for overall total sales, right behind the Massachusetts and New York lotteries. "Decisions the Texas Lottery made in the last fiscal year have proven to be successful and invaluable to the state of Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "We were in fourth place in 2001, and with rising sales in 2002, we surpassed the California Lottery by more than $69 million. Our goal is to be number one again soon." Total sales for Fiscal Year 2002 were $2,966,262,259. Since 1992, the Texas Lottery Commission has transferred more than $10 billion to the state. Of that, more than $5 billion has been transferred to the Foundation School Fund to help pay for education. "Congratulations to the staff, players and retailers of the Texas Lottery for all the hard work and effort in helping us reach this milestone," said Greer. "With the team we have here in Texas, we're reaching for new heights." The Texas Lottery ranked number one in total cumulative sales in 1994 and 1995, with more than $5 billion and $8 billion, respectively.
