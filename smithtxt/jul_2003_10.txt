First Go At Texas Lottery® Twice As Grand Instant Game Nets Player $2 Million
(Austin, July 16) - For Tom Joyner of Mount Pleasant, a first-time attempt at a new Texas Lottery® instant game turned out to be the buy of a lifetime. Joyner is the first Texas Lottery player to win the top-cash prize for the new Twice As Grand instant game, which allows players a chance to win $2,000 a week for 20 years. "I first thought that this isn't true," Joyner said. "It was my first ticket with this game, which I bought on July third. I took it to the store and had the owner take a look at it just to be sure I had won." Joyner purchased his Twice As Grand ticket at South End Grocery, located at 1101 South Jefferson in Mount Pleasant. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. "What an exciting way to start playing Twice As Grand," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We strive to create games that are fun and allow players an opportunity to win big money, and with Twice As Grand, it looks like we've done just that." The $5 ticket hit retail locations in February. There are two ways players may win $2,000 a week for 20 years. In the top play area, if a player's YOUR NUMBER beats THEIR NUMBER in any one row across, win the prize shown. If the prize shows 2GRAND, players win the top prize. In the bottom play area of the instant ticket, players must match any three like amounts. If three "2GRAND" symbols are shown, players win the top prize. The total prize payout comes to $2,080,000, before taxes. Other cash prizes include: $500, $50, $20, $15, $10 and $5. Tonight's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth an estimated $28 million.
