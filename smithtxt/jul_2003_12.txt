Two-Day Winning Streak For Cuero Texas Lottery® Player

Carlos Gottschalt of Cuero cashes in on two-day lucky streak. He won more than $13,000 with Cash Five game.

(Austin, July 11) - Today, Carlos Gottschalt of Cuero cashed in on his lucky streak from last week. Gottschalt won one of the four top-prizes for the Cash FiveTM drawing held on Thursday, July 3. He purchased another Cash Five ticket for the drawing the following night and matched four of the five numbers, winning $135. "My wife and daughter didn't have any trouble believing me when I told them about winning the second night," Gottschalt said. "I play Cash Five off and on when I'm feeling lucky. I hope the luck just stays." Gottschalt's five-of-five matching ticket netted him $13,588 before taxes. He purchased both of his winning Cash Five tickets at the Circle K #9416, located at 111 East Morgan in Cuero. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $135.88 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. "I found out Friday morning when I read the Victoria Advocate that I had matched all the numbers," Gottschalt said. "I'll probably do some work around the house; build a porch on it for my wife, and maybe take a little vacation." The winning numbers were: 10 - 33 - 24 - 28 - 15. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $900,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
