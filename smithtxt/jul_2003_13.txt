(Austin, July 2) - It's time to load up and ride out -- to the closest Texas Lottery® retailer. Starting today, players can purchase their chance to win a piece of an American legend, a Harley-Davidson® FLSTC Heritage Softail® Classic motorcycle, with the new, 2003 edition of the Texas Lottery® Harley-Davidson® Instant Game, featuring the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a 100th Anniversary Harley-Davidson® motorcycle. "We're so excited about the re-launch of this instant ticket," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "This is truly a game that allows players a chance to fulfill a dream - to sit up on the seat of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and ride across the highways and byways of this great state." Players have the chance to instantly win one of 12 limited edition 100th Anniversary Harley-Davidson® FLSTC Heritage Softail® Classic motorcycles or one of two top-cash prizes of $50,000. Speaking from the Austin Harley-Davidson/Buell dealership, Greer explained how the first ticket launch for the Texas Lottery® Harley-Davidson® scratch game set an industry record within the first month. "Last year, we broke an industry sales record for the themed instant ticket, beating the previous record holder, the California Lottery," he said. "We sold more than $12 million worth of the Harley ticket in the first four weeks of ticket sales, and it remained one of the top 10 scratch-off games for more than 14 weeks after its launch."
