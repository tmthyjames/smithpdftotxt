Wichita Falls Man Claims Final Top Prize In $130,000 Bonus Scratch Off Game
(Austin, July 28) - Harry Martin of Wichita Falls really only stopped in at the Shop-N-Go for a snack and a cup of coffee. At the checkout stand though, Martin, an occasional Texas Lottery® Scratch Off game player, decided to take a chance on a couple of $130,000 Bonus tickets. "I'm really not a heavy Texas Lottery player; although I've always enjoyed the intrigue and anticipation of the scratch off games," said Martin. "I usually stick with the $2 tickets, but this time I decided to splurge." Martin's splurge paid off to the tune of $500 per week, which comes out to $26,000 per year before taxes, for the next five years. Martin says he's already got some ideas about what to do with the money, including purchasing the home he and his family have been renting for the last three years. When Martin got home and scratched off the winning ticket, he thought he'd won $500 at first. "That was pretty exciting, but then I realized it was $500 a week," said Martin. "That's when I got really excited and broke the good news to my family." "Excitement is what the Games of Texas are all about," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Whether it's a top tier prize like this or one of the lower level prizes, it's always exciting to win. The millions of Texans who play our games responsibly are proving that every day." Though the five top cash prizes for the $130,000 Bonus game have now been claimed, there are still cash prizes of $1000, $500, $100, $75, $50, $30, $15, $10 and $5 remaining. Martin purchased his winning ticket at the Shop-N-Go #2 Store, located at 1431 32nd Street in Wichita Falls.
