Fort Worth Woman Becomes First Top-Prize Winner In 12th Anniversary Million Instant Game
(Austin, July 23) - Lailoma Mohmand of Fort Worth today became the first million dollar winner of the Texas Lottery® 12th Anniversary Million scratch-off game. The $20 ticket hit Lottery retailers in May of this year in celebration of the Texas Lottery Commission's 12-year anniversary. "We're celebrating big this year," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Since May, we've introduced the state to three new millionaires. With the addition of Ms. Mohmand, we've had two winners that were instant millionaires with one of our scratch off games, and one winner for the record $145 million Lotto Texas jackpot." The 12th Anniversary Million game still has a single million dollar top-prize unclaimed. In addition to the top prize, there are other cash prizes available, such as: $10,000, $1,000, $400, $200, $100, $80, $40 and $20. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 2.78. "I always buy scratch tickets for birthday and Christmas gifts, and this is the first time I bought one for myself," said Mohmand. "I picked out this ticket because I liked the way it looked. It looked lucky." She purchased her million-dollar winning ticket at M and M Food Store, located at 100 N. Forest Hill Drive in Everman. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the prize-winning ticket.
