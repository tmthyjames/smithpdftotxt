$9 Million Lotto TexasTM Winner Calls Mom From Lottery HQ - Tells Her He Won Big Money

TLC Executive Director Reagan E. Greer applauds as MacArther Petty of Dallas calls his mother to tell her the good news.

(Austin, July 22) - With Texas Lottery® staff hooting and hollering in the background, MacArther "Mac" Petty of Dallas called his mother from Lottery headquarters in Austin today and gave her the news every mother wants to hear; her son won the Lottery. "I called her to surprise her with the news that I was getting a check for more than $5 million today," Petty said. "We hung up, but she called me right back; she wasn't sure what I'd said." Petty is the winner of the July 7 Lotto TexasTM drawing that advertised a jackpot of $9 million. The winner purchased his ticket with the Cash Value Option that gives him the net present value of the jackpot, which is $5,780,028, before taxes. "What a great way to surprise someone, especially your mother," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "I had the privilege of talking with her on the phone during the check presentation, and she was having a hard time catching her breath. She asked me, 'Is he telling me the truth?' and what can you say but 'yes, of course, he really won.' This is certainly a first for us; we've never had a winner call anyone during the check presentation to say that they've won. It was great fun for everybody." Petty told Lottery officials that he's got definite plans for his prize. "I want to buy my mother a house," he said. "I also have three sisters and I want to help them, too." As far as he's concerned, there's one thing he plans to purchase for himself pretty quickly. "I'm getting an SUV," he said. "I'm not sure yet what kind, though. Later, I'm going to buy a house." Petty bought 30 Quick Pick tickets. "I usually buy five and no more, but this time something told me to buy 30 tickets," he said.

TxLottery: News Release

The new winner found out his ticket had won when he read the numbers in The Dallas Morning News. "It hasn't exactly hit me, yet," Petty said. "Sometimes, I get really excited about it, but mostly it fades in and out." He may get a little more excited when he sees the seven-figure balance in his bank account. The Texas Lottery makes a direct deposit of the winner's prize into his or her bank account, where it will appear in two or three business days. The winning ticket was purchased at Jack's Grocery, 1601 Market Center Boulevard in Dallas. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $90,000, one percent of the advertised $9 million jackpot. The winning numbers were 16-24-36-37-39, and the Bonus Ball number was 24. Friday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $47 million. The jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is an estimated $9 million.
