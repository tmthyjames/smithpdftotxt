Mr. Monopoly Says Pass Go And Collect $25,000; Play Instant MonopolyTM From The Texas Lottery®

The Instant Monopoly ticket features hotels as icons to be scratched and 10 chances to win.

(Austin, July 20) - It's a game like no other and an American cultural icon. The Texas Lottery this week introduces Instant Monopoly to players, bringing one of the most recognizable names in the gaming world to Texas. "Mr. Monopoly might have to think about trading his top hat for a Stetson now that he's in the Lone Star State," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Monopoly has been one of the most popular games in American households for the last 70 years, and now we've brought it here as an instant game for our players." Fashioned after the traditional board game that was created in Germantown, Pennsylvania, by Charles B. Darrow in 1934, the Instant Monopoly ticket features hotels as icons to be scratched and 10 chances to win. "That's how players find out if their hotel icons win any one of the 2.1 million prizes the game offers," said Greer. "And for those who don't win, there is a second-chance drawing that gives them the opportunity to win an official Franklin Mint MONOPOLYTM Collector's Edition game board or an official MONOPOLY prize package by mailing in two non-winning MONOPOLY tickets." The odds of winning any prize are one in 4.65, including break-even prizes. The game offers prizes in the following amounts: $25,000, $2,500, $1,000, $200,$100, $50, $25, $15, $10, $8, $5, $3 and $2. The traditional MONOPOLY game is sold in 80 countries and offered in 26 languages.
