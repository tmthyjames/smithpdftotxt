Wife Wins $24,327 Lotto TexasTM Prize After Husband Gives Her Another's Unwanted Ticket

Jackie Mann holds a ceremonial check for $24,327 from last week's Lotto Texas drawing.

(Austin, July 12) - A customer told Wayne Mann of the Texaco Food Mart that he wasn't going to pay for the Lotto TexasTM ticket he had just asked for. Mann had no choice but to buy the unwanted ticket. And it was a good thing he did, too, because the ticket he gave his wife matched five of the six numbers drawn for the July 7 Lotto Texas drawing.

while to sink in." The Manns said they had no big plans for their winnings, but their grandson, Jacob, who came with them to the claim center at Lottery headquarters, said one word to his grandmother, "Wave Runner." "I guess that's what we'll do," Mrs. Mann said. "Tonight we'll go to dinner to celebrate and think about getting that Wave Runner." Tomorrow night's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is an estimate $20 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $5 million.
