Big Jackpots, New Scratch Games Lead To Texas Lottery® Highest Sales Month In History
(Austin, July 1) - The first month of summer has come and gone, and in its wake it left the highest sales total in the 12-year history of the Texas Lottery®. Overall sales for the month of June, which include sales for Scratch Off games, Lotto TexasTM, Cash FiveTM, Texas Two Step®, Pick 3TM, Mega MillionsTM and the MegaplierTM totaled more than $391.6 million. "It's incredible what the past month meant for the Texas Lottery," said Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We had a record Lotto jackpot, a record sales week and now a record sales month. And July just might give last month a run for the money since Friday's Mega Millions drawing is now worth an estimated $290 million." Since joining the Mega Millions group seven months ago, Texas' total sales exceed $154 million. Sales for the Megaplier feature, offered only in Texas, are nearly $38 million, for a total amount of more than $192 million. "We also introduced new Scratch Off games that really have players excited," Greer explained. "We launched Corvette Cash, the first instant ticket we've had that allows players a chance to win a 2004 Corvette Convertible. Sales also started for Texas' first $25 instant ticket, Run The Table, with a chance at one of three $1,000,000 cash prizes." Sales for the previous record-setting month for the Texas Lottery, November 1996, were approximately $344 million.
