Sherman Lotto Texas Winner Says He's Too Young To Quit Working - Has Other Plans For His $8.5 Million Win
(Austin, June 26) - - Chester Brown is proof of the saying, "You can't keep a good man down." The 80-year-old Sherman resident told lottery officials he plans to keep working at Lamberth Texaco, even though he claimed his share of the estimated $70 million Lotto Texas jackpot from the Saturday, June 22, drawing. Brown, who chose the Cash Value Option payment, will receive $8,502,425. "I'm too young to quit now," Brown said. "I have to do something."

Brown worked for the retailer owner, Chapman Oil Company, for 14 years before retiring the first time. He went back to work for the company a little over a year ago at the Sherman store, after his wife of 55 years passed away. "I've set up a living trust in her name," Brown told officials. "Two churches, a women's crisis center, the Denison shelter and a veteran's center will benefit from my win." Brown purchased his jackpot winning ticket at Lamberth Texaco on Friday, June 21. His ticket was one of five winning tickets for the $70 million jackpot, and was the only one purchased before the day of the drawing. The retailer, located at 2510 Highway 75 south, is eligible to receive a bonus of $100,000. "The boss called me up to congratulate me," said Brown. "He said, 'Chester, I can't believe it.' That's what everyone is saying, and I keep saying, 'I don't have anything to show for it yet.' " Brown explained that he purchased 250 tickets for the Saturday night drawing. "I don't usually play like that, but I just had a feeling about it," he said. "The next morning I showed up at work like usual, and heard that a winning ticket had been purchased at the store. I didn't have my tickets with me so I went back home and brought them back. It turned out to be the second ticket we looked at, and the winning numbers were on the second line.

I won about $20 on the rest of my tickets," he added. Brown said he doesn't have many other plans for his new found wealth. He said he is buying a new Lincoln Town Car (dark blue top and light blue body) and maybe a new recliner. "For me and my dog, 'Little Guy'," he said. "Maybe he'll let me sit in it. He's a little spoiled." Brown explained that his little black poodle, which he's had for six years, is a finicky eater. "He likes French fries, but only from Whataburger. And he'll only eat in the living room. I wouldn't sell him for the amount I'm getting today." Brown arrived at Texas Lottery headquarters in Austin today with his manager, Dawn Maxey. According to Brown, "she's my right arm, helps me with everything." As of today, there are still four winning tickets remaining to be claimed at Lottery headquarters. One ticket was purchased in Austin at the Stop N Go, located at 933 E. Rundberg Lane. One ticket was purchased in Longview, at the Stop & Shop, located at 5003 Estes Parkway. A ticket was purchased in Pearland at Housco Tech Inc., located at 1601 East Broadway. The last ticket was purchased in Terrell at McDonald's Fuel Station at I-20 Hiran Road, Exit 509. There has been no word from the ticketholder (s) for the Terrell ticket. Sales for Saturday's estimated jackpot amount were actually higher than expected, therefore pushing the payout amount to $74, 226,172. This makes the third highest Lotto Texas jackpot won by players since the game's inception in November 1992. The record Lotto Texas jackpot was $85 million won in March 2001, by an Austin police officer. When asked how it felt to be a winner for one the largest Lotto jackpots, Brown said, "It won't change me a bit. I'll just get to work a little later now." The estimated Lotto Texas jackpot for tonight's drawing is worth $4 million. Related Stories:
