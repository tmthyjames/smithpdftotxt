Five Tickets To Split Saturday's $70 Million Jackpot The Fourth Largest Lotto Texas Prize
(Austin, June 22) - - Today's $70 million Lotto Texas jackpot, the largest for this fiscal year and the fourth largest in the game's history, will be split between five lucky ticket holders. And four of the five winning tickets were sold today, the day of the drawing. "Once again, Lotto Texas has created excitement statewide and generated extra sales for the state," said Linda Cloud, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "This is great for the players and also for Texas' school children and our hard working retailers. "And if anybody had any doubts that the Lotto game wouldn't produce the high jackpots our players enjoy, today's jackpot should erase any lingering doubt." The five winning tickets were sold at: Austin - Stop N Go #2069, 933 E Rundberg Lane q Longview - Stop & Shop, 5003 Estes Pky Sherman - Lamberth Texaco, 2510 Hwy 75 South Terrell - McDonald's Fuel Station, I-20 Hiran Rd., Exit 509 Pearland - Housco Tech Inc., 1601 E. Broadway

"The drawing day is the big magnet for sales," Cloud said. "On Saturday, players purchased just over $21.5 million ($21,586,587) in tickets. At 11 a.m., ticket sales began crossing the $1 million-per-hour mark and never slowed down." Average per-minute sales peaked during the 8 PM-9 PM hour, topping out at 41,949 every 60 seconds. "Once we rolled to $68 million Wednesday night, we felt our estimates were probably conservative," Cloud said. "In fact, the next day, we broke our sales record for a Thursday, usually one of the two slowest sales days because it follows the drawing. We registered more than $3.3 million that day, prompting our bumping the jackpot to $70 million." The retail outlets that sold the five winning tickets are eligible to share an equal amount of a bonus of one-percent of the jackpot, not to exceed $500,000. Saturday's winning numbers were 16-11-02-13-34-26. "Now, it's essentially a waiting game: the Texas Lottery Commission waiting for all the claimants to call headquarters and come to Austin to claim their prize," Cloud said. "We want to shake their hand, give them their money and welcome them into Texas' Millionaire Family hall of fame. That's what the 'Games of Texas' are all about." The next Lotto Texas drawing will be Wednesday, June 26, 2002. The estimated jackpot is $4 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
