Lotto Texas Sales Keep Climbing; Jackpot Bumped To $70 Million
(Austin, June 20) - - It has only happened five times before over the last 10 years, but today Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud bumped the estimated $68 million Lotto Texas Saturday jackpot to a new high amount of $70 million. "Our sales shot out of the bin this morning, and coupled with higher than expected sales for the past two days, it is clear that we can offer our players a significantly bigger prize for Saturday night," Cloud said. "And, if there's no winner on Saturday we will reach a new record high-possibly climbing into the triple digit range." The previous record high jackpot was $85 million in March 2001. At the peak of sales for yesterday's $50 million jackpot, players were buying nearly 30,000 tickets per minute. "Wednesday's single day sales were in excess of $14 million," Cloud said. "There's no question, we've got some Lotto fever going on. We like to remind our players, however, to be prudent when they buy tickets, to play responsibly. It takes only one dollar to play-and one ticket to win." Cloud said Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is the highest in the nation. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time". By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the TLC has generated more than $9.4 billion for the state and paid more than $15 billion to players in prizes.
