Wichita Falls Retailer Receives $85,000 Bonus, His Second For Selling Winning Lotto Ticket
(Wichita Falls, June 7) - - Few Texas Lottery retailers can boast of this, but they'd like to. In May of 1994, Ron Clement's K-C Oil in Seymour sold a winning Lotto Texas ticket valued at $16.6 million and won by Rachel Morgan of Seymour. For selling the big winner, his store won a bonus of $166,000.

Now one of his stores has done it again. The K-C Oil #6, located at 2906 Central Expressway in Wichita Falls, sold a Lotto Texas jackpot-winning ticket worth $8.5 million. "Of course, you're always hoping you'll win," said Ron Clement, president of the company. "So this is nice, it's real nice, because in this kind of business, you always have a place to spend money." In fact, he says the bonus has already been set aside. "It's done spent," Clement said with a laugh. "As you might guess, I've got the usual bills to pay." René McCoy, Texas Lottery Commission marketing specialist, presented Clement with the check today. "I think Mr. Clement has a trend going," McCoy said. "Now we'll all be waiting to see which one of your stores sells the next Lotto Texas jackpot winner." Clement's store sold the ticket to the CJ & Barbara Melton Family Limited Partnership of Burkburnett. The winners claimed their share of the $17 million jackpot prize on Friday, May 10.
