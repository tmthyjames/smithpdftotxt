Somerville Man Claims $33,594 Second-Tier Prize In New Lotto TexasTM

Wayland Theodore Mock of Somerville, a winner of a second-tier prize in Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing. His prize for matching five of six numbers was $33,594.

(Austin, June 23) - A 21-year-old Somerville man claimed the third-largest second-tier prize in the new Lotto TexasTM game. Wayland Theodore Mock went to the Bryan Claim Center today and turned in his ticket for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing. His prize for matching five of six numbers was $33,594. The highest second-tier prize was $54,772, followed by a $35,561 second-tier prize from May 7, the first drawing of the new game. But Mock played more than one set of numbers on his ticket and that won him a "second" prize. "He matched three numbers with his other set of numbers," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "That earned him another $5, so his ticket was worth $33,599. What a lucky guy!" Mock agrees. "I've played the same numbers for about two months and finally got lucky," he said. "Your luck can change. You just have to have faith." Mock said his plans for his winnings include getting a car and getting clear of debt. The numbers from Saturday's drawing were: 19-26-21-14-9 and the Bonus Ball number, 24. Mock matched five numbers but not the Bonus Ball. "People all over Texas are playing--and winning--the new Lotto Texas," said Greer. "Mr. Mock is one of 65,970 players who won a total of $449,507 in prizes." Because there was no 6-of-6 winner, Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
