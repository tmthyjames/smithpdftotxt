Two-Steppin' Toward A Record...Seven Tickets Share In Texas Two Step Top Prize
(Austin, June 23) - Texas Two Step players set a record Friday night, as seven tickets each took a $28,571 piece of the $200,000 top prize, for matching four numbers plus the bonus ball. "Talk about being all over the map, practically every corner of Texas scored a top-prize winner in Friday night's drawing," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "From El Paso to Paris, down to Woodsboro, up through San Antonio and through Mesquite onto Sherman, we had a Texas Two Step top-prize winner. Not only that, we had a whopping 76 winners who matched four numbers, when we usually have approximately 12 to 15 per drawing. Our players gave us record-breakers in both categories." The winning numbers for Friday's Texas Two Step were 3 - 10 - 17 - 24, with 17 as the bonus ball. "Many of our players were on the same wave-length, too, because six of the seven top-winning tickets were based on selfselected numbers," Greer said. "And if you take a close look at the numbers, you'll see how the first four digits are seven numbers apart if you line them up in numerical order." The seven winning tickets were sold at the following locations:
