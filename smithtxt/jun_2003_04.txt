Mesquite Texas Lottery® Player Finds Winning Quite Nice

Melinda Hammers of Mesquite, three-time winner of two of the 'Games of Texas.'

(Austin, June 20) - She's only played the Texas Lottery about five times, and that was all it took for 20-year-old Melinda Hammers of Mesquite to win big in two of the 'Games of Texas.' Her ticket for the Cash FiveTM drawing on Monday, June 16, earned her $26,766. But she had another ticket with her today when she came into the Texas Lottery Commission's Dallas Claim Center. "She also turned in a 'lil ole' Texas Two StepTM ticket from the June 6 drawing that matched four numbers in that game," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "That brought her another $1,432. Our staff is used to excited winners, and they really enjoyed helping Melinda. What a lucky young lady." Melinda said she bought two tickets for the Cash Five game. One was a Quick Pick, and the other she chose the numbers at random. It was the ticket with her numbers that earned her the top prize of $26,766. One other ticket sold in Grapevine also matched the five numbers for that drawing. Melinda learned of her fortune Tuesday morning, when she saw the numbers in the Dallas Morning News. Her Dad, who Melinda says plays "all the time," told her that it looked like she had a winner. Melinda called her fiancé who at first didn't believe her. "We're getting married soon, so we really needed this," Melinda said. "It was such a blessing." Melinda said she'll use the money to pay for the rest of the wedding, and then pay for college. She wants to be a teacher and is taking classes now at Eastfield Community College. Melinda bought her Cash Five ticket with the multidraw option, making her five numbers (20-25-26-30-34) good for six drawings. All five numbers came in the first night of her ticket, earning her the $26,766, and three came in the next night for $11. With the Texas Two Step winnings of $1,432 added in, her total winnings came to $28,209, before taxes.
