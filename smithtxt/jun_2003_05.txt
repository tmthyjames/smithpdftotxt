Big Cities Score Big Second-Tier Wins In Wednesday's Lotto Texas

Floyd Perman of Dallas was one of the two Lotto Texas winners of the 5 + 0 prize of $14,648.

(Austin, June 19) - Dallas and Houston were on Wednesday night's Lotto Texas map, with a winner in each city of the 5 + 0 prize of $14,648. "We've got two winners from last night's draw that are shocked and amazed that they won," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "This just proves what we've said all along, that the new Lotto Texas gives you more chances to win significant prizes. And they weren't the only ones who took home a prize...we had more than 51,000 winners in last night's Lotto game." The wins came courtesy of Quick Pick tickets that both winners picked up Wednesday. Both winners could have been knocked over with a feather, but for slightly different reasons. Floyd Perman, 56, is retired but working part-time. He read the winning numbers in the Dallas Morning News at 5:50 a.m. today. "I kept checking and re-checking the numbers because you're really surprised to see them on your ticket and in the paper at the same time," he said. "I had to stop on my way to work and get a print-out at a convenience store just to make sure the numbers were the same, and, sure enough, they were. It makes you feel fantastic."

The prize he won will make the trips he had already planned for this summer that much more fun. "I'm going to visit my family back in Ohio and use some of this money for that" he said. "Then, in August, I'll be in Palm Springs for a week with a group of friends at a house we leased together. What I have left, I'll put away." Perman bought his ticket at the Get N Go, located at 11424 Audelia Road in Dallas. The other winner, Alberto Maldonado of Houston, however, had a different kind of winning experience. "I thought I'd won $1,400, not $14,648," Maldonado said. "They kept telling me it was not $1,400, but much more. That's a good mistake to make. I called my wife and she couldn't believe it either, and she let me know right away that we're going to use the money to put wood floors in our new house." He used four quarters to buy his ticket at the Hollywood Store, 2003 W. Alabama, in Houston. The winning numbers were 36 - 34 - 01 - 14 - 24, with 01 as the bonus ball number. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $8 million.
