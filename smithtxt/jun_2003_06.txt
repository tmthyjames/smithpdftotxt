Texas Lottery® Winner Puts The Brakes On Roadtrip To Collect $200,000

Before driving on to Arkansas, Betty Flowers had to stop to collect her $200,000 at Beaumont Lottery Claim Center.

(Austin, June 18) - Betty Flowers of Hull was on her way to Arkansas today for her nephew's wedding. Instead, she had to stop at the Texas Lottery Commission's Beaumont Claim Center to pick up a little extra spending money - $200,000 to be exact. Flowers' Texas Two StepTM ticket for last night's drawing, with its $400,000 jackpot, was one of two that matched all four numbers plus the Bonus Ball. "I have a set of numbers I always play, and I usually buy one Quick Pick set of numbers, too," Flowers said. "It was the Quick Pick ticket that won. I'm still in shock." Flowers purchased her ticket at Carolyn's Drive Inn, located at 2304 FM 770 in Hull. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $2,000 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. The numbers drawn for the Tuesday, June 17 drawing were: 03 - 26 20 - 17 and the Bonus Ball number was 11. Flowers told lottery officials her immediate plans for the money are to pay off bills. "I think everyone says that," she commented. "It's great to hear that the Texas Lottery helped provide a little extra spending money to our latest Texas Two Step winner," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "It sounds like Betty already has one great memory from a road trip to Arkansas, and we're glad to have been a part of it." The second jackpot winning Texas Two Step ticket was purchased in San Antonio at Ram Stores #24, located at 27755 Highway 281 North. Friday's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $200,000.
