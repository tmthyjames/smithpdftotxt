Ladies And Gentlemen, Start Scratching... Fast Tracks Offers Trip To Nascar Race
(Austin, June 18) - Rev up your engines. You might soon be on your way to an official NASCAR® race, thanks to a new Texas Lottery® game that goes on sale today. The new instant game, called Fast Tracks, offers a top cash prize of $25,000, and a second-chance drawing that gives players a shot at winning a four-day, three-night trip for two to legendary speedways in Daytona, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Talladega or Texas. The game features NASCAR® drivers Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Bill Elliott, Jeff Burton, Mark Martin, Ricky Rudd, Greg Biffle and Matt Kenseth. "This is the first time in our 11-year history that we offer a trip as a prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We're going to have five second-chance drawings and give away two trips at each drawing. The winners get to choose which official NASCAR® race during the 2003 or 2004 seasons they'd like to attend. Round-trip airfare, first-class hotel accommodations, $500 in cash, and a special VIP upgrade package are all included. It's a great deal." Players can enter by mailing in two non-winning tickets in an envelope no larger than a #10 envelope to Fast Tracks Second Chance Drawings, 4287 Belt Line Road, PMB 370, Addison, Texas 75001. "At each drawing, we're also giving away 556 additional prize packages of official NASCAR® merchandise that includes a uniform jacket, a leather travel bag, an official t-shirt, a limited edition photo plaque, and a baseball cap," Greer said. The second-chance drawings will be open to the public, and the results will be posted on the Texas Lottery's Web site approximately one week after each drawing. The second-chance drawings occur on July 22, August 12, September 2, September 23, with the final one dependent on the number of tickets remaining in the game as of September 23. The date of the final drawing will be announced later. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
