Late Night Purchase Earns Fort Worth Man $1,000 A Week In Texas Lottery® Instant Game

Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer and winner Sergio Villarreal of Fort Worth.

(Austin, June 13) - A fan of the Texas Lottery Weekly Grand scratch-off game, Sergio Villarreal of Fort Worth, is thanking his lucky stars that a late-night grocery purchase gave him change to play his favorite instant game. After scratching off the ticket in the store, Villarreal found himself holding a ticket worth $1,000 a week for 20 years, or $1.04 million, before taxes. He claimed his top-prize today at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin. "We're delighted that our latest winner turned spare change into quite a bit of cash," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "Weekly Grand is one of the most popular instant games from the Texas Lottery, and I'm glad Mr. Villarreal won with his favorite game." Not sure he had won, Villarreal asked staff at the Carnival Food Store, where he made his winning purchase, to check the ticket for him. The grocery store is located at 1706 W. Irving Boulevard in Irving. "First I thought I didn't win because I didn't see any dollar sign symbols...they're what I usually see when I win one of the other prizes," said Villarreal. "And then I saw the word 'Grand' and I just stopped everything." An occasional player, Villarreal said he had won $300 a number of years ago on a Weekly Grand ticket and it immediately became his favorite game. "Every now and then I'll buy a Weekly Grand or other scratch-off game, or sometimes Lotto Texas, and for sure when it's a high jackpot," he added. Villarreal said he intends to continue working as an assistant manager at a grocery store and since he doesn't need anything, he wants to make sure his two children benefit. "My entire family is excited, and they're glad it's someone they know," he said. "Now I want to take care of my immediate family and make sure the children are set up for when they grow up. I might even take a little vacation."
