Garland Dad Gets Early Father's Day Present From The Texas Lottery®

Garland resident Doug Winters collects $47,035 on Texas Lottery Cash Five game.

(Austin, June 13) - Doug Winters of Garland was on his way to pick up his father for a little Father's Day weekend getaway. The two made plans to drive to Shreveport, Lousiana, today and visit the Horseshoe Casino to play the slots. Instead, Winters had to make a quick stop at the Texas Lottery Commission's Dallas Claim Center to collect his Cash FiveTM top-prize of $47,035. "I stopped to put gas in the car, and while I was there I asked the girl behind the counter to check the few lottery tickets I had with me," Winters said. "She gave me $2 on two of the tickets I had, and then when she ran one of the others she said the screen read, 'See Lottery Office.' She told me I must have won more than she could pay me." While driving over to the Claim Center, Winters called his son and asked him to look on the lottery's Web site and tell him how much the prize was worth. "He read me the numbers and I said, 'You're not going to believe me, but I have all five of them,' " Winters said. "I figured I was going to have to split the prize with other winning tickets, and my son said, 'You're not going to believe me, but there was only one winner. It's you Dad, you won.' " The winning numbers drawn were: 04 - 29 - 06- 30 - 03. "What a great way to start off Father's Day weekend," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "So far this week, players matched numbers to win more than $830,000 in the Texas Lottery's Cash Five game."
