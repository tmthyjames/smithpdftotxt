For Lubbock Sailor, There's No Place Like Home And Texas Lottery® Games

Just in time - Airman Joshua Ridener cashes in on $1,000 Texas Lottery prize before leaving with the Navy again.

(Austin, June 12) - For many sailors, returning home from overseas on military duty is a long-anticipated occasion. And for one Lubbock sailor, Airman Joshua Ridener, the return home also meant being able to play Texas Lottery® scratch-off games again. One of the first things Ridener did when he returned home was buy an instant ticket, Fun In The Sun, and he sure had some when he discovered he'd won $1,000. "I was sitting in my car when I scratched it and I was shocked," said Ridener, 22. "It's always a pleasure to give winners their prize money," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "With this winner, we also give him our thanks for serving our country."

"He's assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 137, nicknamed the 'Kestrels,' as a Plane Captain," explained Mrs. Ridener. "He is teamed with a fighter plane and pilot and checks the plane before the pilot can fly it." She said that her son has been in the Navy for three years and had just returned from Iraq aboard the U.S.S. Constellation. "While we're pleased that Airman Ridener was able to claim his prize prior to reporting to his duty station, a bill authored by Senator Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio would provide him with some additional time if he hadn't collected his winnings," said Greer. "Senate Bill 6, which is awaiting the Governor's signature, would extend the prize claim period for members of our military forces who are transferred out of state prior to claiming a prize." Senator Van de Putte serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs and Military Installations. Representative Kino Flores of Mission was the House sponsor of Senate Bill 6. He serves as Chairman of the House Licensing and

Administrative Procedures Committee. The winning ticket was purchased at Town and Country #221, located at 3401 98th Street in Lubbock.
