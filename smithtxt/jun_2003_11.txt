Sunny Days Ahead For San Antonio Weatherman Who Wins $1 Million In Texas Lottery® Scratch-Off Game

San Antonio weatherman, Dan Brounoff accepts his $1,000,000 prize from Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer

(Austin, June 12) - No more cloudy days for Daniel Brounoff, a television meteorologist at News 9 San Antonio, now that he's won $1 million in the Texas Lottery® $1,000,000 Classic scratch-off game. Today, Brounoff claimed his top prize at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin. "Looks like the days just got sunnier for Dan," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "Who could have 'forecast' this would happen to him?" "After the roller coaster ride my life has taken the past year, and especially the past few weeks, winning $1 million with the simple scratch of a ticket is just what I needed," said Brounoff, 37. "I have been playing this $20-game the past month, and I had won $500 in Georgia on one of its instant games, but I've never won anything like this." A native Texan, Brounoff said that since landing a job in February with the Cable TV station in San Antonio, his life has gone through a whirlwind of events. "Because I couldn't afford to pay rent in San Antonio while paying a mortgage in Atlanta, I lived in a trailer that belonged to a relative," Brounoff explained. "My wife stayed in Atlanta to try to sell our house, but she was pregnant, out of work with no maternity leave." He said that in early May, he moved his wife, Stefani, to Houston to stay with her mother.

admitted to a hospital in Dallas for a mild heart attack. He said he was at his mother's bedside when she passed away, three days after the birth of his son. After the funeral, he then went to spend several days with his wife and son in Houston. "I drove back to San Antonio on June 5, bought a scratch-off Lottery ticket on June 6, and became a millionaire!" exclaimed Brounoff. The winning ticket was purchased at Big Diamond #1007, 3411 Thousand Oaks, in San Antonio. Brounoff plans to move his wife and son to San Antonio when his wife can travel, take care of some debt, and make life good for his son. He said he has every intention of continuing his weather forecasting job at News 9 San Antonio. The $1,000,000 Classic instant game started April 23 and, as of June 7, more than 2.3 million of these $20 tickets have already been sold. Brounoff won the third of the five $1-million prizes. The Texas Lottery currently has four instant games that offer prizes of $1 million or more - $1,000,000 Classic, Twice As Grand, Weekly Grand and Holiday Million.
