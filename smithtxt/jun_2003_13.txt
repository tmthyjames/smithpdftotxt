Houstonian Claims $37 Million Jackpot As First Winner In New Lotto TexasTM Game

David Kelly, first winner of the new Lotto Texas game that was changed in May, with Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer.

(Austin, June 9) - In the hopes of funding a new school, David Kelly, 37, bought 20 Quick Pick tickets for Saturday's Lotto TexasTM drawing for a $37 million jackpot. His matching ticket makes him the first winner of the new Lotto Texas game that was changed in May. Today, Kelly claimed $24, 211,786, the Cash Value Option sum, at Texas LotteryTM headquarters in Austin. "In addition to David's impressive $37 million jackpot, 118,000 other winners won nearly $800,000 in additional prizes in Saturday's game, which shows just how winnable the new Lotto Texas is," said Reagan E. Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "We've averaged 83,399 matching tickets per drawing, and we're hoping those players who haven't yet tried the new game will take notice of all the winners this weekend and take a chance with this week's drawings." Kelly, a Houston resident, said that while he occasionally plays Texas Lottery games, he intentionally bought 20 tickets for Saturday's drawing after learning more about the possibility of helping a few friends open a school in Houston. "I told one of my friends that I needed to win the Lottery if I was going to be able to do something about opening a school," explained Kelly. With his winnings, he said he hopes he'll be able to help the community and the children in that area. Kelly purchased the winning ticket at Texas Star Stop, located at 15415 Eastex Fwy., in Humble. The retailer is eligible for a 1 percent bonus of $370,000 for selling the winning ticket. The winning numbers were 31--06--25--05--44, and the bonus ball was 27. As Greer mentioned, Kelly was not the only winner in Saturday's Lotto drawing. The 118,571 tickets that won are shown below by prize category:
