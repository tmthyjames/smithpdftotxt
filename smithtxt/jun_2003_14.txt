Single Lotto TexasTM Ticket Marks Highest Win So Far Since New Game Started
(Austin, June 5) - While no ticket matched all five numbers plus the Bonus Ball to win last night's Lotto TexasTM jackpot, one ticket did match the first five numbers. The player or players who have the ticket hold the distinction for the highest prize won for a single ticket so far with the new Lotto Texas game. "We had one ticket for last night's drawing worth $54,772, and we're eagerly waiting to meet that player or players," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Someone out there is going to be very happy when he or she checks that ticket. The prize was just part of the more than $680,000 that made up prizes won for Wednesday's drawing." The ticket matched the first five numbers in the Lotto Texas drawing. The numbers drawn were: 35 - 40 - 31 - 07 - 39 and the Bonus Ball number was 16. The ticket was purchased at Courtesy Mart #4, located at 304 East Front in Hawkins. The ticket can be validated at any one of the 21 Texas LotteryTM Claim Centers located throughout the state. The closest claim center to Hawkins is located at 3800 Paluxy Drive, Suite 330, in Tyler. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $37 million.
