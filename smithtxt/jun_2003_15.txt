Players Match Tickets For More Than $4.5 Million In First Four Weeks Of New Lotto TexasTM
(Austin, June 4) - It's been four weeks since the Texas Lottery Commission introduced Texans to the new Lotto TexasTM game, and, so far, players have matched tickets worth more than $4.5 million in prizes in the first eight drawings. "With each week and each drawing that goes by, Texans are really cashing in on the improved overall odds of winning with the new Lotto Texas game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "We've averaged 83,399 matching tickets per drawing, and we're hoping those players who haven't yet tried the new game will take a chance with tonight's $33 million jackpot." A complete breakdown of matching tickets and the amount won for each Lotto Texas prize tier, except the jackpot prize, follows:
PRIZE TIER Match 5 numbers Match 4 numbers + BB Match 4 numbers Match 3 numbers + BB Match 3 numbers Match 2 numbers + BB Match 1 number + BB TOTAL TOTAL # MATCHED TICKETS 36 156 7,028 5,913 261,064 72,560 320,439 667,196 TOTAL PRIZE AMOUNT $339,019 $308,904 $659,619 $583,205 $1,305,320 $362,800 $961,317 $4,520,184

"We're anticipating that players will become more excited as the jackpot continues to grow, and as they hear about how many of their fellow Texas Lottery players are winning with Lotto Texas," Greer said. "If no one wins tonight's jackpot, then Saturday's drawing will be in the upper-$30 million range, a level we haven't seen since January," he added. The new Lotto Texas game is projected to produce three to four jackpots between $65 and $100 million in a 52-week period. The last Lotto Texas jackpot to reach those levels was June 2002 when a $70 million jackpot was divided among five tickets that matched all six numbers. Players now choose five numbers from a field of 44 numbers, and a Bonus Ball number from a second field of 44 numbers.
