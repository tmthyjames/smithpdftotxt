Run Away With A Million Dollar Prize; Play Run The Table, Newest Texas Lottery® Instant Game
(Austin, June 30) - Texas Lottery players have a brand new opportunity to win a million dollars. Starting today the newest Scratch Off game to hit the streets, Run The Table, allows players the chance to run away with three $1,000,000 top-cash prizes. "Run The Table is the first $25 instant ticket that the Texas Lottery has ever offered players," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Through research, we have found that player groups appreciate the higher price point tickets due to the large payouts and great overall odds of winning other cash prizes." Run The Table offers players the chance to win other cash prizes, including: $20,000, $10,000, $2,000, $1,000, $500, $200, $100, $50, $40, $30 and $25. The odds of winning one of three $1,000,000 prizes are 1 in 1,680,000. The overall odds of winning any prize, including break-even prizes, are 1 in 2.78. "There are six different games to play on Run The Table and players can win up to 24 times," said Greer. "The cash prize payout for the game totals more than $91 million." Players must be at least 18 years old to play this or any other Texas Lottery game. The number of prizes in a game is approximate based on the number of tickets ordered. The number of actual prizes available in a game may vary based on number of tickets manufactured, testing, distribution, sales and number of prizes claimed.
