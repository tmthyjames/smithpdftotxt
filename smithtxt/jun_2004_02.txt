Mega MillionsTM Players Score Big With Second- And Third-Tier Prizes
(Austin, June 30) - While no ticket in any of the 11 states that participate in Mega Millions correctly matched the five numbers plus the Mega Ball, Texas players won 24 second- and third-tier prizes for a total of $995,000. "We had 217,708 winning tickets in last night's Mega Millions drawing, the holders of which get to claim prizes ranging from $2 to $175, 000," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Players with winning tickets won more than $2 million last night. I'm hoping everybody who won knows they're holding a ticket that matched some part of the correct combination of numbers." Five tickets matched five numbers minus the Mega Ball for a prize of $175,000. Sold in El Paso, Channelview, Houston, Missouri City and Lewisville, those tickets were not purchased with the MegaplierTM feature. Out of the 19 tickets that matched four numbers plus the Mega Ball number, five were purchased with the Megaplier number, which was "2" for last night's draw. The tickets with the doubled prize of $10,000 were sold in Alvin, Hurst, Lancaster, Pampa and Texarkana. The rest were sold in Irving, Pharr, San Antonio, Whitney, Orange, Rosenberg, Plano, Dallas, with three others sold in Sugarland and two more in Houston. Total sales for last night's Mega Millions drawing were $9.5 million, with $6.8 million of that sold yesterday. "Proceeds from Mega Millions go to the Foundation School Fund, just like the proceeds of all our games," said Greer. "Out of every dollar spent on a Mega Millions ticket, 38.6 cents goes to this fund that supports public education in Texas." The Texas Lottery joined Mega Millions in December, 2003. There have been 60 drawings to date. Friday night's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $280 million. The drawing will take place in Times Square in New York City, where it will continue to occur until someone wins.
