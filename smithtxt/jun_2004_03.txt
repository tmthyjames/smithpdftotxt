Mega MillionsTM Bumped To $220 Million
(Austin, June 28) - The jackpot for Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM drawing got more interesting this morning, as the jackpot was bumped to $220 million from $210 million. "The directors of the 11 lotteries that participate in Mega Millions decided to bump the jackpot this morning," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Sales are certainly strong enough to support the bump, so we decided to sweeten the pot." Texas joined Mega Millions in December of last year. To date, there have been 241 winners who matched four numbers plus the Mega Ball. There have been 52 winners who matched five numbers minus the Mega Ball. "We're still waiting to have our first Mega Millions jackpot winner here in Texas," Greer said. "If other states can have jackpot winners, we can too. It's just a matter of when." The Mega Millions drawing takes place at 10:12 p.m. Tuesday night. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM is worth an estimated $6 million.
