June 19 Is A Big Day For Texas Lottery® Winners, Including A Million Dollar One From Spring
(Austin, June 25) - Saturday, June 19, was a big day for the Texas Lottery® and two Lottery players from Spring, Texas. Today, just a few days after the record-breaking Lotto TexasTM jackpot, the Texas Lottery presented the Sullivan Lovett Lottery Partnership the top-cash prize for the Weekly Grand scratch off game. The partnership will receive $1,000 every week for the next 20 years, making the total prize payout $1,040,000, before taxes. "I called my boss on Sunday morning to tell him that I couldn't come in on Monday because I needed to go to Austin," Chad Lovett, one of the partners explained. "He asked me if I had one the big one and I told him, 'No, but I got one (prize) that's pretty good." Lovett said he got the ticket only because he miscalculated his change from buying gas. "I told the clerk, 'Just give me a two dollar ticket and make sure it's a winner.' She sure listened to me." He purchased the ticket at the RACETRAC #540, located at 407 FM 1960 EAST in HOUSTON. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for selling the grand prize-winning ticket. "What an incredible day last Saturday turned out to be. We ended up with million dollar-winning tickets on opposite sides of the state," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Congratulations to our latest million dollar winner, and stay tuned for more about that 'other' ticket." Since the Scratch Off game was first introduced to players in 1995, there have been 65 top-prize Weekly Grand winners. "My boss gives away a Weekly Grand ticket as an incentive to us for loan approvals," said Randina Sullivan, the other partner of the Sullivan Lovett Lottery Partnership. "I told him last week when I left work that if I won over the weekend, I wasn't coming in on Monday. I had to tell him that it finally came true." The couple told lottery officials they plan to purchase "a home and a Harley."
