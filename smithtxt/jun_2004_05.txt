For Saturday's Cash FiveTM Winner, Second Time Buying A Texas Lottery® Ticket Was A Charm

Gerardo Olivares of Anna, claimant of a Cash Five prize of $13, 057.

(Austin, June 24) - Gerardo Olivares of Anna had purchased Texas Lottery® tickets only once before Saturday night. The Cash FiveTM ticket he bought for that night's drawing carried a charm, a prize of $13, 057. "My daughter picked the numbers and put them in my pocket," Olivares said. "I was in Plano and stopped in at the Racetrac to buy a ticket. I almost couldn't read them when I bought the ticket. But they won." "Mr. Olivares proved what we always say, it takes only one ticket to win," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Cash Five has been one of our most popular games since it began in 1995. Among our online games, it's got some of the best overall odds of winning any prize, one in eight." Olivares found the winning numbers on the Texas Lottery's Web site, www.txlottery.org. "This is it, I told myself," he said. "I looked the ticket over 100 times. It was shocking. I probably got one hour of sleep that night thinking about it." The new winner says he's already figured out how he's going to spend his money. "I'm going to invest in my kids' educations," he said. "I might also use some of the money to invest in a business." Olivares purchased the ticket at Racetrac #616, 520 Jupiter Road in Plano. The retailer is eligible to earn a bonus of one percent of the winner's prize, which is $130.57. "Winning doesn't just make you feel thankful," Olivares said. "It also makes you feel humble. I've got a lot to be thankful for." For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
