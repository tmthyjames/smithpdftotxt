Record Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Ushers In Biggest-Ever Sales Week At The Texas Lottery®
(Austin, June 24) - Saturday's record $145 million Lotto TexasTM jackpot proved to be the driving force in a $122 million sales week that outranks all others in the 12-year history of the Texas Lottery®. "We're calling it the 'wow' week," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "On top of that, sales from the beginning of this roll cycle when the jackpot was at $4 million on February 27 until last Saturday night, sales have totaled more than $200 million, of which approximately $70 million benefits the Foundation School Fund. Our sales are tracking nearly 10 percent over last year at this time." Lottery proceeds are sent to the Foundation School Fund, which benefits public education in Texas. To date, the Lottery has sent more than $6.3 billion to the Foundation School Fund. "Nearly 36 cents out of every dollar spent on a Lotto Texas ticket goes to the Foundation School Fund," Greer said. "Overall, we send 30 cents of every dollar spent on a Texas Lottery product to the Foundation School Fund, which means that approximately 30 percent of last week's record sales will be transferred next month." Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. Friday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is set at an estimated $177 million.
