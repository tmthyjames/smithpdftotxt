Texas Lottery® Players Will Soon Have Chance At Big Money On Monday And Thursday Nights
(Austin, June 22) - Tonight's Texas Two Step® drawing will be the last Tuesday night drawing for the Texas Lottery® game. Starting on Monday, June 28, the Texas Two Step drawings will be held on Monday and Thursday nights, joining the Cash FiveTM and Pick 3TM lineup of games. "The move gives players the chance to win big jackpots every night now except Sundays," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "After careful consideration, the commission voted in April to change the draw nights for Texas Two Step because of competition with the multi-state Mega Millions jackpot game." In the game's three-year history, there have been a total of 138 jackpot winning tickets sold. The highest single payout, $1.5 million, was awarded to Gwendolyn Kelly of Cameron in 2002. "Texas Two Step has been very successful for the Texas Lottery and the state," said Greer. "Since the game started in May of 2001, sales have totaled more than $227 million, and players have won more than $110 million." Players still choose four numbers from a field of 35 and a Bonus Ball number from a second field of 35. The odds of winning the Texas Two Step jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million and the overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 32. The cost to play is $1. Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $425,000.
