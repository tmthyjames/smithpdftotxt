Lotto TexasTM - Highest In The Nation, Highest In Its History And Second Highest Single-State Jackpot In U.S. History

Things are bigger in Texas! Saturday's estimated Lotto jackpot is a whopping $145 million.

(Austin, June 16) - Texas is definitely the place to be right now, and the Texas Lottery® Lotto TexasTM game is the one to play. If you've been out-of-pocket for a while, here's a brief re-cap of how Lotto Texas has broken all kinds of records in its 11-and-ahalf-year history in just the last week. It's currently the highest jackpot offered in the United States. It's at the highest level reached since its inception. "And we're nipping at the heels of the number one spot reached by a single-state Lotto jackpot," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Only California has had a jackpot larger than our own $145 million." Since no ticket matched all five numbers and the Bonus Ball, Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot does roll to an estimated $145 million. There were 25 tickets that matched the first five numbers, but not the Bonus Ball, and are worth $9,959 each. In all, there were 501,120 other cash prize winners for tonight's drawing, and the prize payout totaled $3,359,725 million. Sales peaked at 36,969 per minute between 7 and 8 p.m. Sales for this drawing exceeded $27.6 million, while today's sales surpassed $19 million.
