Lotto TexasTM Climbs Even Higher; Jackpot At A Whopping $120 Million For Wednesday
(Austin, June 12) - Lotto TexasTM hit an unprecedented level tonight, tossing out an estimated $120 million jackpot for next Wednesday's drawing. No one hit the five numbers plus the Bonus Ball Saturday night to claim the $100 million prize that was up for grabs. "It's true what they say, things are bigger in Texas, especially this Lotto jackpot," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Texas has the two highest jackpots in the United States right now. Lotto Texas is at a phenomenal $120 million, and Mega Millions is following close behind at an estimated $100 million." There were 370,757 winners who matched numbers for other cash prizes, including 27 tickets that matched the first five numbers, but not the Bonus Ball, for a cash prize totaling $7,017. The numbers for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing were: 35 - 29 - 20 - 10 - 15 and the Bonus Ball number was 16. "As exciting as this whopping jackpot is, we encourage our players to play responsibly," Greer said. "We want players to remember to have fun, but not to bet the farm on this prize. Remember, it's only a game." For more information about the Texas Lottery®, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
