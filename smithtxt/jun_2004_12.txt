'Lotto Fever' Is Taking Over The State
(Austin, June 10) - While walking by the office water cooler this morning, chances are you're hearing the buzz about the latest craze to take over Texas - the $100 million Lotto TexasTM jackpot. "It's hard not to hear all the talk," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "This is what we promised players almost a year ago when we launched the new Lotto Texas game. We said there could be jackpots between $65 and $100 million at least three to four times in a 52-week period." While no tickets matched all five numbers plus the Bonus Ball for last night's drawing, there were 195,918 winning tickets that matched numbers for other cash prizes. Players won more than $1.3 million. "It's definitely an exciting time right now," Greer said. "I do want to remind everyone to please play responsibly, and remember that for every dollar they're spending on Saturday's drawing, approximately 36 cents is going to the Foundation School Fund." Friday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $85 million and the Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $225,000. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $100 million.
