Texas Lottery® Eager About South Texas Mega MillionsTM Ticket - $175,000 Prize Still Unclaimed
(Austin, June 8) - Most Texans are thinking of ways to keep cool now that summer has come again. The Texas Lottery® wants Texans to think about where they may have placed a Mega MillionsTM ticket purchased in the southern part of the state in December. As of today, a south Texas prize-winning Mega Millions ticket is still unclaimed, and the deadline to collect the $175,000 prize is fast approaching. "A ticket purchased in Brownsville matched the first five numbers for the December 12, 2003, drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "The ticket is worth $175,000 and so far, we've heard nothing from a ticket holder. The deadline to claim the prize is Wednesday, June 9." The winning numbers for the December 12 drawing were: 09 - 16 - 32 - 45 - 46 and the Mega Ball number was 26. "Texas Lottery players have 180 days after the date of a drawing to claim their prizes," said Greer. "Whoever has that ticket can have it validated at the Texas Lottery Harlingen Claim Center or any one of the other 15 Claim Centers located throughout the state." The cash prize-winning ticket was sold at the Circle K #7085 at 1250 FM 802. "Being a resident of the area, I would really hate to see a local person miss out on this type of prize," said Texas Lottery Commissioner, Rolando Olvera. "I encourage everyone to look for any Mega Millions tickets they have in their possession and that may have been purchased during December. They only have a few more hours to claim their prize." As of today, there is still one other $175,000 Mega Millions ticket for a December drawing still unclaimed. The ticket was purchased at the R&R Food Mart at 7644 N. Gessner Drive in Houston for the December 30 drawing. The deadline to claim the prize is Friday, June 25. Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $71 million.
