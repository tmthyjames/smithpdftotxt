Record $87 Million Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Set For Wednesday Night's Drawing
(Austin, June 8) - The summer's starting off with an $87 million bang, as the Lotto TexasTM jackpot rolls to a new record for Wednesday night's drawing. "We've got the biggest jackpot in the nation," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The last time we were in this neighborhood was in March of 2001 when we posted the now-broken record jackpot of $85 million. This is the kind of Lotto jackpot that gets the attention of players not only in Texas, but also in our neighboring states and in Mexico. Come on in, the Lotto's fine." Since the Lotto Texas game began in November of 1992, there have been 480 jackpot-winning tickets sold. "We've had winners from workplaces, such as the Luckiest GM 9 Partnership, winners from tiny towns and big cities, you name it, they've been here," Greer said. "And we can't wait to see who's going to win tomorrow night, whether one ticket or several match Wednesday night's numbers for a record jackpot prize." For last Saturday's $81 million Lotto Texas drawing, ticket sales hit a peak during the 8 p.m. hour, when tickets were selling at a rate of more than 13,000 per minute. There were 158,821 winners who won a total of $1,108,497 at other prize levels in the game. "We expect to see the same kind of sales excitement for tomorrow's record drawing," Greer said.
