Lotto TexasTM - Largest Jackpot Since 2001, Largest Jackpot In The Nation Today
(Austin, June 3) - It's sizzling up to be a hot weekend for the Texas Lottery®. Not only is the Lotto TexasTM jackpot at the highest level seen since March 2001, it's still the highest single-state lottery jackpot offered in the nation today. "Players all over Texas and our surrounding borders may catch the 'fever' starting tomorrow," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Right now, Texas boasts the two highest jackpots in the United States. Lotto Texas is nearly at an all-time record high of an estimated $81 million, and Mega Millions is following close behind at an estimated $60 million." No tickets matched all of last night's Lotto Texas numbers for the estimated $75 million jackpot. There were 133,690 winners who matched numbers for other cash prizes, including nine tickets that matched the first five numbers, but not the Bonus Ball, for a cash prize totaling $7,332. The numbers for last night's Lotto Texas drawing were: 03 - 30 - 38 - 06 - 11 and the Bonus Ball number was 30. "This year has certainly been an exciting one for the Texas Lottery," said Greer. "Specifically, we saw the first-ever jackpot offered in Texas that was more than $200 million with Mega Millions, we had a $70 million jackpot with Lotto Texas in January, through May 22 we've paid out more than $19.7 billion in prizes, and we just celebrated our 12-year anniversary." Friday's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $525,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
