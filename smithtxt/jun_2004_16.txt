Texas Two Step® Mystery Ticket Holder Faces Deadline To Claim $325,000 Jackpot
(Austin, June 1) - After 5 p.m. today, whoever is holding the sole jackpot-winning ticket for the December 9, 2003, Texas Two Step® drawing has just 27 hours left to claim the $325,000 jackpot prize. "If the ticket holder doesn't show up at one of the 16 Texas Lottery Claim Center's doorstep by 5 p.m. on Friday, June 4, there will be one more Texas Two Step unclaimed jackpot going into the record books," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. The Quick Pick ticket was purchased at the Circle K #52146, located at 2882 Main Street in Ingleside. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $3,250 for selling the winning Texas Two Step ticket. The winning numbers drawn were: 01 - 06 - 11 - 29 and the Bonus Ball number was 33. "Anyone who was in Ingleside in December, and purchased a Texas Two Step ticket at that Lottery retail location, needs to check for tickets they still have in their possession," said Greer. "If no one turns the ticket over for validation by the deadline, the $325,000 prize will be transferred to the General Revenue Fund." Since Texas Two Step began in May 2001, there have been two jackpots to go unclaimed. Tonight's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $425,000.
