Stolen Lottery Tickets Help Nab Overnight Robbery Suspect In Houston
(Austin, March 22) - - An attempt to cash in stolen Texas Lottery tickets has led to the arrest of one suspect in connection with last night's aggravated armed robbery of a Houston area retailer. According to Sun Moon Food Mart owners, last night at approximately 8:30 p.m., two individuals entered the store, located at 7170 Lawndale Avenue, and demanded money out of the register and more than a dozen packs of Texas Lottery scratch-off games. The two suspects were reportedly armed with a gun and a knife. At 8 a.m. this morning, Texas Lottery Security Investigators in Dallas were monitoring sales transaction computer screens and began noticing some of the stolen tickets being cashed-in. They directed Houston robbery detectives to the exact location where one suspect was apprehended at that time. "One of the suspects appeared to become nervous while trying to cash-in the scratch-off tickets and was apprehended while leaving a retail location on the 800 block of Dumble Drive," said Steve Wilson, Texas Lottery Commission Investigator. -30....
