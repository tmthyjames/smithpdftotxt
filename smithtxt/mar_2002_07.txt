Dallas Lottery Retailer, Quiktrip #903, Receives $50,000 Retailer Bonus
(Austin, March 21) - - It hasn't been all that long since Dallas lottery retailer QuikTrip #903 sold one of the two jackpot winning Lotto Texas tickets for the drawing held February 2nd. Today, the Texas Lottery Commission made a "quick trip" to Dallas to present the lottery retailer with a ceremonial check for $50,000. "We're very pleased to present this bonus to QuikTrip," said René McCoy, Texas Lottery Commission Representative. "This store is such a positive influence in this sales district, and it's been a pleasure working with these wonderful people." The jackpot, worth an estimated $10 million, was split between two winners. Luis Uribe of Carrollton claimed his part of the jackpot on February 20th. Uribe purchased his Quick Pick ticket at the last minute while purchasing cigarettes at the store, located at 2968 Forest Lane. That "quick" decision paid off more than $2.8 million. On hand to accept the ceremonial check were QuikTrip Business Trust representatives. The other ticket was purchased at an Albertson's in the Humble/Atascocita area, near Houston. The winner, Max E. Shannon, purchased his winning ticket with the 25-year annuity option. He received an initial payment of $200,000, and will receive the same amount every February for the next 24 years. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $13 million.
