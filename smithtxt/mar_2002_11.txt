Texas Lottery Commissioners Approve The First Ever Day Drawing In Texas
(Austin, March 6) - - Today, the Texas Lottery Commission voted in favor of creating the first-ever-day-drawing for the Texas Lottery's mix of online games. The first Pick 3 Day Drawing will be on Monday, April 29th, at 12:27 p.m. The game will remain exactly the same, only now it will occur twice daily, Monday through Saturday, with the second Pick 3 drawing of the day at 9:59 p.m. To play Pick 3, players select three numbers each from 0 to 9, with four choices for how they can play their 3-digit combination (Exact Order, Any Order, Exact/Any Order or Combo). Cost to play will remain as little as 50 cents for a single Exact or Any Order play, or as much as $360 on a Combo play where the numbers are played for twelve draws. Last week's Pick 3 sales totals were the 3rd highest in the game's history, a record $4,890,090.50. Pick 3 was the lottery's second online game, which began in October of 1993. In other developments, the Texas Lottery also proposed changes to the lottery's Cash 5 game. The proposal included the following modifications:

Overall odds of winning change from 1 in 100 to 1 in 8, making it easier to win prizes Players will win a guaranteed prize of $2 for matching just two numbers Drawings will be held six nights a week instead of four Players will choose five numbers out of 37 instead of 39

The proposed changes make Texas the only state in the U.S. to have a 5-of-5 game that gives a $2 cash prize for matching only two numbers. It is also the biggest cash prize offered at that prize level. Currently, Cash 5 players choose five numbers from 39. Tickets cost $1 per play. Players win cash prizes by matching 3, 4, or 5 numbers. Prize amounts are approximately $25, $500, and $57,000 respectively. All prizes are pari-mutuel. The proposed changes will be published in the Texas Registry for a 30-day public comment period, and a public hearing to discuss the proposed changes is scheduled for April 4, 2002, at 9 a.m. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
