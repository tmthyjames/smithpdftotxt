Texas Lottery Commission Approves Lotto Texas Changes
(Austin, March 27) - Today, the Texas Lottery Commission approved the new Lotto TexasTM game rule. Sales for the new game will begin Sunday, May 4, with the first drawing to be held on Wednesday, May 7. "The new Lotto Texas game will provide players with a chance to win higher-level jackpots and increase their overall chances of winning," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer. "And, we anticipate the changes to generate additional sales, and that translates into more revenue for the State of Texas." Greer said it is estimated that the new game may generate more than $50 million in additional revenue during the first full fiscal year of sales. The new Lotto Texas will be a bonus ball-style game similar to Texas Two StepTM. Players will choose five numbers from one field of 44 numbers, and then choose a Bonus Ball number from a second field of 44 numbers. The odds of winning the jackpot prize will change from 1 in 25.8 million to 1 in 47.7 million. The game also will include the following features:

"Our sales figures confirm that players are speaking with their dollars and want to participate when the jackpot gets to a higher level," said Greer. "The new Lotto Texas game gives players what they told us they want-higher jackpots. We hope that players will try the new game-and appreciate what we've done when they see the higher level jackpots, as well." Players will continue to choose the jackpot payment options at the time they purchase their Lotto Texas tickets, and the cost to play will continue to be $1. Drawings still will be held every Wednesday and Saturday night at 10:12 p.m. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth $7 million. Since the Texas Lottery began in 1992, more than $10.3 billion has been transferred to the State of Texas. Total FY '03 sales-to-date are $1.74 billion, up 8.4 percent from FY '02 sales-to-date of $1.61 billion.
