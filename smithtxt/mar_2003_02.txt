Two Houston Winners "Step Up" To Claim Share Of $1.8 Million Texas Two StepTM Jackpot
(Austin, March 27) - Two of three winners who matched the winning numbers for the record jackpot of $1.8 million for the Texas Two StepTM drawing held Tuesday night by the Texas LotteryTM, stepped up to claim their share of the prize. Each jackpot winner will share the jackpot, with winnings of $600,000 each, before taxes. Two of the three winners came to the Houston Claim Center to pick up their checks: Callie Elmore of Houston, and Mario Martinez, also of Houston. The third winning ticket has not yet been claimed. "It was exciting to see the Texas Two Step jackpot reach an historic $1.8 million," said Reagan Greer, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director. "Our phones were busy with calls from eager players. Now we're hearing from our jackpot winners, and that's a new level of excitement." Martinez, 39, said that his favorite Texas Lottery games are Lotto TexasTM and Texas Two Step and that he also buys scratch-off tickets. "I routinely buy between five to seven tickets for Texas Two Step every Tuesday and Friday," said Martinez. "But I also always play responsibly and pay my rent and bills first." Martinez said he got so busy that he almost forgot it was Tuesday and time to buy his Texas Two Step tickets. He usually picks his own numbers, as he did for this particular drawing. The prize money has been earmarked by Martinez to help his family and friends because he said it makes him feel good to help them and he also wants to pay off some of his own bills. He said he has simple advice for other players: "Buy a ticket, because if you don't play, you can't win." Martinez bought his ticket at Sunny Quick Store, located at 7225 Hillcroft in Houston. Elmore purchased her ticket with playerchosen numbers at Get N Go, located at 7051 Monroe in Houston. The third prize-winning ticket was a Quick Pick and was sold at Daps Stop N Shop at 600 E. Highway 84 in Teague. The retailers each are eligible to receive a $3,333.33 bonus for selling the top-prize-winning tickets. The winning numbers drawn were: 27-33-4-12 and a Bonus Ball of 24. In addition, a total of 35,604 winners will share a collective total of $307,925 in the various prize categories. Prizes of $600 to $999,999 may be claimed at any of the 22 regional lottery claim centers. Prizes up to $599 may be claimed at any Texas Two Step retailer. The estimated jackpot for Friday's Texas Two Step drawing is $200,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.
