Texas Two Step Reaches Record Jackpot - $1.8 Million - For Tonight's Drawing
(Austin, March 25) - Tonight marks a record milestone for the Texas Two Step game. Just months shy of the two-year anniversary of this Texas LotteryTM game, the jackpot for tonight's drawing, $1.8 million, is the highest the Texas Two Step has ever rolled. If no one matches the winning numbers tonight, the jackpot will roll to $2.1 million for Friday's drawing. "This is a great opportunity for our players to 'step up' and win the largest jackpot in this game's history," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer. "And even though no one won the jackpot on Friday's drawing, we did award more than 33,000 winners' prizes totaling $291,618." Texas Two Step reaches record jackpot of $1.8 million The previous record, $1.6 million, was split between two jackpot-winning tickets in October 2001. With five months left of this fiscal year, total sales for Texas Two Step is expected to reach at least $65 million. "Texas Two Step is one more example of how the Texas Lottery continues to introduce games that create excitement with our players. It offers a smaller jackpot prize than Lotto Texas, but with better odds of winning," said Greer. "We hope Texans who might have never played Texas Two Step before will join in for the chance at tonight's record jackpot." Texas Two Step is drawn every Tuesday and Friday night at 10:12 p.m. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
