Texas Two Step Reaches Record Jackpot - $1.8 Million - For Tuesday Night Drawing
(Austin, March 24) - Tomorrow will mark a record milestone for the Texas Lottery'sTM Texas Two StepTM game. Just months shy of the two-year anniversary of the game, the jackpot for Tuesday night's drawing, $1.8 million, is the highest the Texas Two Step has ever rolled. "This is a great opportunity for our players to 'step up' and win the largest jackpot in this game's history," said Texas Lottery Commission's Executive Director, Reagan Greer. "And even though no one won the jackpot on Friday's drawing, we did award more than 33,000 winners prizes totaling $291,618." The previous record, $1.6 million, was split between two jackpot-winning tickets in October 2001. Texas Two Step, which began on May 13, 2001, replaced the Texas Lottery's Texas MillionTM game. In comparison, the first full fiscal year of sales of Texas Two Step outperformed Texas Million in its first full fiscal year by more than $3.8 million. With five months left of this fiscal year, total sales for Texas Two Step is expected to reach at least $65 million. "Texas Two Step is one more example of how the Texas Lottery continues to introduce games that create excitement with our players. It offers a smaller jackpot prize than Lotto Texas, but with better odds of winning," said Greer. "We saw the excitement last week with Friday's drawing and expect Texans who might have never played Texas Two Step before to join in for the chance at Tuesday's record jackpot." To date, there has been one Texas Two Step jackpot to go unclaimed. On Sunday, December 22, 2002, the 180-day deadline passed for a ticket worth $300,000. The ticket was purchased in Grand Prairie at the Whip In #1001, located at 3502 South Carrier, for the drawing held on June 25, 2002. Texas Two Step is drawn every Tuesday and Friday night at 10:12 p.m. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org Texas Two Step reaches record jackpot of $1.8 million
