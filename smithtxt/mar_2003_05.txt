Texas Lottery Commission Sales Manager Frank Coniglio congratulates Bill Breetz, President of the Southwest Marketing Area for Kroger.

(Austin, March 21) - Kroger #817 in Grand Prairie today received a ceremonial check in the amount of $250,000 as a retailer bonus for selling one of the two jackpot-winning Lotto Texas tickets for the $53 million January 22 drawing. Frank Coniglio, Texas Lottery Commission Sales Manager, presented Kroger representatives with the check at the noon ceremony. "It's a great pleasure to present Kroger with this retailer bonus of a quarter of a million dollars" he said. "Our retailers provide a vital link with our players, and Kroger has certainly done its part to help us provide our players with the games they enjoy. Thanks to everyone at Kroger for the leadership they've provided throughout the years. Congratulations to you and all your employees for a job well done." The Texas Lottery has approximately 16,300 active retailers, Coniglio said. The Texas Lottery has awarded Kroger more than $855,000 in retailer bonuses from all games since the Lottery began. "We're very excited to have been one of the stores that sold one of the winning tickets," said Russell Richard of Kroger Community Affairs Media Relations. "It was great for Kroger and exciting for our employees. The day after the drawing, we had all the major networks visiting the store. It really created a lot of buzz in our store." The Texas Lottery pays a bonus to any Lotto Texas retailer who sells a 6-of-6 jackpot-winning ticket, in accordance with Lottery procedures. The retailer bonus equals 1 percent of the jackpot won by the customer, not to exceed $500,000 per drawing. The Perkov Family Trust claimed its half of the jackpot on February 7. Rosalie Perkov of Arlington is the trustee. The winner chose the Cash Value Option, which gave the trust a prize of $16.2 million before taxes. She purchased the winning ticket while lunching with a group of friends that regularly meets at Kroger, which is located at 2525 West I-20 in Grand Prairie.
