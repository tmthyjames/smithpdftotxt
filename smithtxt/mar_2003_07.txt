Austinite Wins $77,000 From Texas Lottery
(Austin, March 17) - If you can't finish your lunch at the venerable Joe's Bakery on Austin's East Side because you've got a winning Texas Lottery ticket in your pocket, then you won't be able to eat anywhere. "I just couldn't concentrate on eating knowing that I had a little ticket with $77,000 on it in my pocket," said Leonard Prado. "I nibbled just enough so I wouldn't be quite so hungry, then I took off to the Lottery to get my prize." The 53-year-old Prado bought three Royal 7's instant game tickets. He says he plans to be prudent with his prize. "I'll pay off my car and tie up a few financial loose ends, but I'm not going to go crazy spending this prize," he said. "The only place I really want to go to is Louisville, for the Kentucky Derby, so I'm going to treat myself to a trip." Prado says he buys only three tickets at a time, whenever he's in any retail location that sells Texas Lottery tickets. It was no different when he purchased three Royal 7's at Mr. MC's Grocery, located at 2109 Holly Street in Austin. "I buy only three tickets, and I never ever scratch them in the store, because if I win, I might want to buy more tickets," he said. "But this time, I scratched them in the store, and I got really excited, but the clerk was even more excited than I was." The self-employed travel ticket broker says he enjoys gaming in general and travels frequently to Las Vegas. "Some years, I go as many as 10 times to Vegas; I really like it," he said. "But last year, I went only three times. And, as far as my $77,000 prize, all I can say is that I never gave up. I've been playing since the beginning, and I knew I was going to win a big prize someday. Well, here it is." Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $35 million.
