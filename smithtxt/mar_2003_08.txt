(Austin, March 13) - Changing his morning routine, Ernesto Fabela of Odessa bought a Texas LotteryTM Holiday Million instant ticket Monday afternoon that instantly changed his life. Today Fabela, joined by his wife, daughter and father-in-law, visited the Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin to pick up his top prize that totals $1 million before taxes. A daily player of Texas Lottery instant games, Fabela said he adds the Scratch Off games to his morning ritual. "In the morning on the way to work, I go to 7-Eleven, buy a cup of coffee and a scratch-off ticket or two, and then I sit there to relax with my coffee while I scratch tickets." He bought his winning Holiday Million instant game ticket at 7-Eleven #135, 6013 W. University, Odessa. The retailer is eligible for a one percent bonus of $10,000 for selling the ticket. Fabela, 47, made an afternoon stop at 7-Eleven on Monday for a cold soft drink when he decided to buy another instant gamethis time, the $20 Holiday Million that debuted in late November as the lottery's first-ever $20 instant game. Changing yet another routine, Fabela went back to work and scratched the ticket at his job site instead of at the store. "He couldn't believe it; he was jumping up and down and screaming," said his wife, Jane Fabela. "He had played Holiday Million since it came out and had won a few prizes, but nothing really big. This kind of win is unreal."
