Persistence Pays Off For Coppell Cash Five Player Who Wins $43, 381
(Austin, March 6) - After hardly ever missing a Cash Five drawing since the game began in 1995, Neil Rogers of Coppell finally won the top prize in Wednesday night's draw. "I'm getting ready to send my creditors into shock," the 73-year Rogers said. "I'm paying off all my bills with this prize, which also bought me some peace of mind. Next month, I won't be thinking about my bills." Rogers was watching WFAA-TV, Channel 8, in Dallas, when he saw the numbers 3-15-25-29-19 come up on the screen during the newscast. "I couldn't believe it; I kept checking my ticket," he said. "This morning I had to look at my ticket again to make sure I wasn't dreaming." The latest Cash Five winner says he's going to limit his celebrating to inviting his sons out to dinner. "I play things pretty cool as far as celebrating, but I plan to keep playing," Rogers said. "I'm going to get a ticket for Saturday night's Lotto TexasTM game and a few more Cash Five tickets." Rogers sells residential security systems on commission. He schedules his day the way he wants and maintains an active lifestyle. "The undertaker is going to have to catch me" he said. "I stay active. It's what you have to do to maintain good health." Rogers bought his winning ticket at the 7-Eleven #1602-27658, located at 100 W. Sandy Lake Road in Coppell. The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus that equals one percent of the top prize, which comes to $433.81 Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $19 million.
