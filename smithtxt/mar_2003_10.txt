Dallas Texas Lottery Player Picks Up The Truck Of Her Dreams

(Austin, March 5) - Deborah Lopez of Dallas has been dreaming of driving a Ford F-150 truck for the last four years but hasn't had the chance to buy one. Today, she picked up her truck at the Texas Lottery Claim Center - her prize for winning one of the Lottery's most popular instant ticket games, Bucks 'N Trucks II. Lopez bought her ticket back in February at Doc's Food Store #3, located at 6465 E. Mockingbird Lane, Suite 525, in Dallas. She was on her way to work at Ace Check Cashing, and she remembers it was an unusual day. "Everything I did that morning was really different from my routine," Lopez said. "I bought twelve dollars' worth of instant tickets at a store I go to maybe twice a year because it's near my mother's house." Lopez said she was alone at work when she scratched her tickets. "When it hit me that I won a truck, I started screaming," she recalled. "I'm glad nobody else was there. Then I called my family and they started screaming, too." Lopez said she currently drives a 2000 sedan but has been wanting a truck because it would be fun and useful, not just for her, but for the rest of her family.

"My kids are real happy that I won the truck, and so are my mother and my cousins," she said. "I might let them drive it around the block, but that's it." Lopez said instant tickets are her favorite games. "I like Bingo and Weekly Grand best of all, and sometimes if the jackpot is around $9 million, I'll buy a Lotto," Lopez said. "But Bucks N Trucks II is my favorite ticket right now. The truth is, I thought I might win some cash, maybe, but never the truck. Made a believer out of me. "I've waited four years for this truck," she said. "Today is my day off, and since this truck comes with a full tank of gas, I'm going cruising all day long." Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $15 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission website at http://www.txlottery.org
