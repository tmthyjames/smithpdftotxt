Valentine's Day Chat Nudges Midland Woman To Check $5 Million Lotto Texas Numbers

Anderson's parents, Marian and Paul Schuh, look on as she tells the story of how she won the Lotto Texas jackpot.

(Austin, March 3) - Valentine's Day was a little sweeter than usual this year for Brenda Lee Anderson of Midland. That's when she realized she held the winning $5 million Lotto TexasTM ticket for the February 12 drawing. Today, Anderson claimed her jackpot prize at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin. Anderson chose the Cash Value Option and will receive $3,038,100 before taxes. A fortunate conversation with her best friend prompted Anderson to check her numbers. "My best friend said no one had claimed the winning Midland ticket," recounted Anderson. "Well, I had bought my ticket at the same 7-Eleven, so we decided to check on it and went back to the store for a receipt with the winning numbers. "We went through the ticket numbers (1, 18, 20, 21, 52, 54) three or four times and my best friend kept telling me to breathe because she didn't know CPR," said Anderson. "And we were just screaming and screaming in the car. People started looking at us, so we got out of the 7-Eleven parking lot fast." Anderson bought her Quick Pick ticket at 7-Eleven #814, located at 4324 Andrews Highway in Midland. The retailer is eligible to receive a $50,000 bonus for selling the top-prize-winning ticket. A self-proclaimed random player, Anderson said she almost didn't buy a Lotto Texas ticket the night of the drawing. "It was late, like 9:45 p.m., and it was cold, so I went into the store to pay with cash instead of using my card at the pump. There were too many people in line, so I just paid and went back to my car. But I decided to go back in and wait behind three people." Anderson has been working two jobs and now plans to focus her efforts on her full-time job. After receiving professional legal and financial advice, she has decided to buy a house with a big yard, a plan that really excites her two children. "My daughter wants a horse in the yard, but I think we'll get a Golden Retriever," Anderson said. "I'll spend a lot of the prize money on my kids and their education." Anderson's parents, Marian and Paul Schuh, traveled from her native state of Wisconsin to Midland to congratulate Anderson. They drove together to Austin for the official celebration.
