Today, Michael Large of Houston became the third to win $1,000 a week for the next 20 years. "It has become one of the Texas Lottery Commission's most popular instant games," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Weekly Grand was first issued in 1995, and since it hit the streets across Texas, there have been 65 winners who've collected the top prize totaling $1,040,000." The instant ticket has been issued a total of 12 times. There are two chances to win the top cash prize on a Weekly Grand ticket.
