Forecast For Mesquite Cash FiveTM Player; Nothing But Green Days Ahead

Naibi Jauhal of Mesquite is the latest Texas Lottery Cash Five winner - collects more than $39,000

(Austin, March 25) - It may be cloudy and gray across much of the Lone Star State; however, Naibi Jauhal of Mesquite is seeing nothing but green for the start of his weekend. Jauhal held the single winning ticket for last night's Texas Lottery® Cash FiveTM drawing, and for matching all five numbers, he collected $39,993, before taxes. "I think today is very nice," said Jauhal. "I've matched four of the five numbers about seven times, and this is the first time I matched all five of them." The numbers drawn for Wednesday, March 24 were: 18 - 17 - 37 - 20 - 15. "Four of the numbers I picked are the ages of my children," he explained. "I've always used their ages when picking my numbers." Jauhal purchased his winning ticket at J & V Chevron, located at 3112 Oates Drive in Mesquite. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $399.93 for selling the five-of-five matching ticket. "It's a good thing to know that Mr. Jauhal will be able to keep using his favorite system for picking his Cash Five numbers, since he can pick numbers up to 37," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Clearly his system helped him win big with his favorite Lottery game."
