TLC Executive Director Reagan E. Greer announces a new milestone this month, as the latest transfer to the Foundation School Fund pushed total contributions to education past the $6 billion mark.

(Austin, March 24) - The Texas Lottery Commission reached another milestone this month, as the latest monthly transfer to the Foundation School Fund from its operation of the Texas Lottery® pushed total contributions to education past the $6 billion mark. "The Texas Lottery was created to generate revenue for the State, and this milestone shows that's just what we've done," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery®. "Since September 1997, about 30-cents of every dollar spent on a Texas Lottery ticket has gone to the Foundation School Fund, which helps pay for public education in Texas. Today, we're proud to say we've contributed $6 billion to public education in Texas." With the March transfer amount of $82.8 million, the cumulative transfers to the Foundation School Fund from Fiscal Year 98 thru the Fiscal Year 04 March transfer total $6,072,810,266. The total amount generated so far in Fiscal Year 2004 is $463 million, $24.3 million more than last year at the same time.

TxLottery: News Release

When the Lottery first began in 1992, proceeds were directed to the State's General Revenue Fund, which received more than $4.9 billion over five years. In 1997, the Legislature dedicated lottery revenues to education, and directed the Texas Lottery Commission to make monthly transfers to the Foundation School Fund. "This milestone is something we're really proud of, and we want to thank the thousands of lottery retailers and the millions of lottery players that made this milestone possible," Greer said. "While we've broken sales records and had many winner highlights, our greatest source of pride is our contributions to public education." "When Texans play, Texas wins," noted Greer. A bill to create the Texas Lottery was introduced in 1991 by State Representative Ron Wilson, Houston. The question of whether Texas would have a Lottery was put before voters on November 5, 1991, and was passed by a 2-to-1 margin. The Texas Lottery began generating revenue for the State initially as a division within the Comptroller of Public Accounts. Funded with a $12 million start-up budget, the Lottery brought in $23.2 million on its first day of sales, May 29, 1992. The Texas Lottery was put under the auspices of the Texas Lottery Commission when that state agency was created on September 1, 1993. The Texas Lottery currently offers players two types of products: Instant ticket games and on-line games. Instant ticket games are those where players utilize preprinted tickets with symbols hidden under a latex covering. These games are also referred to as Scratch Offs, since a player scratches off the latex and determines "instantly" whether a prize has been won. On-line games are those generated from a terminal connected to a central system and a drawing is held to determine a set of winning numbers. The first lottery ticket sold was for an instant game, Lone Star Millions, which went on sale May 29, 1992. Since then, there have been 451 separate instant games, including re-issues of the popular Weekly GrandTM, Break the BankTM, BingoTM, NinesIn-A-LineTM and Find the NinesTM.

The on-line product line-up consists of five games, since the multi-state Mega MillionsTM lottery game joined Lotto TexasTM, Cash FiveTM, Pick 3TM, and Texas Two Step®. The Foundation School Fund is administered by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). According to TEA, the Fund pays for teacher salaries, administration and educational resource costs. "Schools always welcome additional revenue to help them with the increases in enrollments, changing demographics, implementing a new accountability system, serving children with unique and oftentimes very complex needs and, bottom line, simply doing whatever it takes for all children to be successful," said Commissioner of Education Shirley J. Neeley. "I believe we go above and beyond the call to duty to spend our money wisely and make every dollar count. We want Texas taxpayers to believe that all Texas children are receiving a first class, quality education. Texas Lottery, thank you for helping our schools! These funds are greatly appreciated!"
