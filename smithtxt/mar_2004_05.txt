Buda Resident Collects Texas Two Step Prize Of $1,000,000
(Austin, March 23) - Rodney D. Waggoner of Buda came to Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin late Monday and collected the top prize of $1,000,000 that he won playing Texas Two Step® on Tuesday, March 16. Waggoner is the 10th player to win a top prize of $1 million playing Texas Two Step since the game began in 2001. The numbers on Waggoner's Quick Pick ticket were 8--30--18--2 and the bonus ball was 25. "It's been a while since we had a million-dollar winner in Texas Two Step," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The last time someone collected $1 million was last July, and, undoubtedly, some of our players thought it was time to see the top prize climb back up into the seven-figure prize range for this popular game. This is the one that gives our players some truly significant prizes that start out at $200,000." For selling the ticket, the Country Store, 1111 W. Highway 290 in Dripping Springs, is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000. The winner requested minimum publicity. The jackpot for tonight's Mega MillionsTM drawing is an estimated $43 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is an estimated $13 million.
