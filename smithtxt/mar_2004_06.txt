'A Fine Top O' Of The Morning' For Dripping Springs Retailer; Sells Winning Texas Two Step® Ticket
(Austin, March 17) - Someone or some group in Travis County is seeing 'green' today. The Texas Two Step® numbers selected in last night's drawing produced one ticket that matched all four numbers plus the Bonus Ball. The ticket is worth one million dollars before taxes. The numbers drawn were: 8 - 30 - 2 - 18, and the Bonus Ball number was 25. The jackpot winning ticket was purchased at THE COUNTRY STORE, located at 1111 290 West in Dripping Springs. The retail owner is eligible to receive the maximum bonus amount - $10,000 - for selling the top prize Texas Two Step ticket. "Some ticket holder has a little luck of the Irish in them," said Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It rubbed off for the retailer, too. The Country Store is the tenth lottery retailer to receive the $10,000 bonus for selling a million dollar Texas Two Step ticket." Friday's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $200,000 and Mega Millions is worth an estimated $36 million.
