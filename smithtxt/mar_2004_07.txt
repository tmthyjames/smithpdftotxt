Texas Lottery® Jackpot Games Offer Players Three Ways To Become A Millionaire
(Austin, March 16) - The Texas Lottery has something to shout about this week ­ all three of its jackpot games have the potential of making some lucky player a millionaire. The milestone was reached when the jackpot for Texas Two Step® rolled to one million dollars for tonight's drawing. "It's exciting to have all three of our jackpot games at or above the million dollar mark," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "Winning any one of them will make a Texas player a millionaire, and we have hundreds of players who can tell you how much fun that is!" Players have won Texas Two Step jackpots worth one million dollars or more thirteen times, since the Texas Lottery introduced the game in May 2001. The record for the largest Texas Two Step jackpot was set almost one year ago, when the jackpot for the drawing on March 25, 2003, was $1.8 million. Three players had tickets for that drawing that matched all four numbers and the Bonus Ball, winning each of those players $600,000, before taxes. Texas Two Step drawings are held Tuesday and Friday, with jackpots starting at $200,000. To play Texas Two Step, players select four numbers from 1-to-35, and a Bonus Ball number from a second set of numbers from 1-to-35. Players must match all four numbers and the Bonus Ball to win the jackpot. Odds of winning the jackpot in Texas Two Step are approximately 1-in-1.8 million. Overall odds of winning any prize are 1-in-32. The Texas Lottery's other jackpot games are Mega MillionsTM with a $27 million jackpot for tonight, and Lotto TexasTM with a $10 million jackpot for Wednesday. Mega Millions jackpots start at $10 million, and have gone as high as $230 million since Texas joined the multi-state game last December. Odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are approximately 1-in-135 million, and overall odds of winning any prize are 1-in-43. Jackpots for Texas' first on-line game, Lotto Texas, start at $4 million and have gone as high as $85 million. Odds of winning the Lotto Texas jackpot are approximately 1-in-47.7 million and overall odds are 1-in-57.
