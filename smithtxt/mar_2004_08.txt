Texas Lottery® Player "Just Grateful" To Be Latest Cash FiveTM Winner

Oak Cliff resident Dwight Moreland won more than $40,000 for the Friday, March 5 Cash Five drawing.

(Austin, March 16) - Dwight Moreland of Dallas says he's "just grateful" to be one of 12 Cash FiveTM top cash prize winners during the month of March. Moreland held the sole Cash Five ticket for the drawing held on Friday, March 5, and collected $46,306, before taxes, from the Texas Lottery® Dallas Claim Center. "I checked and rechecked my ticket with the printout from the store. Then I cleaned my glasses and checked again," Moreland said. "When I finally got a chance to tell my wife, she couldn't believe it. We just laughed." Moreland purchased his winning Cash Five ticket at Autry's Grocery Store, located at 4903 South Lancaster Road in Dallas. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $463.06 for selling the top-prize winning ticket. The Oak Cliff resident told lottery officials he wants to pay off some bills and go on a little vacation. "We hear that Mr. Moreland is one of the Cash Five game's most loyal players," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We happily get to meet a lot of Cash Five winners considering the overall odds of winning are one in eight and drawings take place six nights a week."
