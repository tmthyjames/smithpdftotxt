Freeport Player Wins Top Prize In Weekly Grand
(Austin, March 15) - Edward Croft of Freeport late Friday claimed the top prize in one of the Texas Lottery's most popular instant games, Weekly Grand. Croft purchased his ticket at Fuzzy's 1 Stop, Hwy. 35, 2.2 miles east of Interstate. Hwy. 172 in La Ward, located in Jackson County. Croft told Lottery officials that every time he passes through the area, he stops at Fuzzy's to purchase a Lottery ticket. And he's always had faith that he would someday win. "I told the clerk 'One day I'm going to win something,'" he said. "Mr. Croft was willing to hang tough with his Lottery tickets, and it paid off handsomely," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It goes to show that if you play, you can win." The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000 for having sold the top prize-winning ticket. The Texas Lottery has offered players 451 instant ticket games since the first game was offered in May of 1992. The ticket Croft purchased is from the 12th re-issue of Weekly Grand. Croft is the 64th winner of the Weekly Grand top prize. The jackpot for Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM drawing is an estimated $27 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is an estimated $10 million.
