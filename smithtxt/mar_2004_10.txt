(Austin, March 11) - The nine co-workers and friends are calling themselves the Luckiest GM9 Partnership. And what a partnership it is - some working together for more than 20 years, playing Lotto TexasTM unfailingly for the last five months, and now they will be linked for ever as Texas Lottery® winners. Members of the Luckiest GM9 Partnership came to Austin today to claim their jackpot prize. "We've read so much about the group and have been waiting patiently to meet them ourselves," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "They're finally here, and I'm happy to present a check for more than $8 million to these nice folks. I want to extend the warmest congratulations and best wishes to the 'luckiest' group of people from Arlington that I've met so far, as Executive Director." Those members of the partnership that participated in today's news conference, Victor and Vera Randers, Debra Hicks, Roger Woodard, Shirley Hill, David Harvey, and three others, won the February 25, 2004, Lotto Texas drawing, worth $12 million. Their ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option payment, which netted them a grand total of $8,003,745, before taxes. The ticket was purchased at Super Save Store, located at 2500 E. Abram in Arlington. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $120,000 for selling the jackpot winning ticket. "We each put in four dollars every Monday for the Wednesday and Saturday drawing," said Victor Randers, spokesman for the Luckiest GM 9 Partnership. "We have a sign-up sheet and I give a copy of the tickets I purchase to each person on the sheet the next morning." The group got to make their drive to Texas Lottery Headquarters in style - the GM Arlington plant provided an Escalade and Suburban to two of the group members. An additional Escalade was provided by Frank Kent Cadillac, two Tahoes were supplied by Lynn Smith Chevrolet and a Yukon was offered by Freeman GMC to other group members. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $8 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
