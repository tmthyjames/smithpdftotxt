Wanted: Holders Of Four Mega MillionsTM Tickets Worth $175,000 Each, Please Step Forward
(Austin, March 10) - If the Texas Lottery® could put up WANTED posters in its claim centers, they would remind players to check their Mega MillionsTM tickets. It's been 99 days since Mega Millions came to Texas, and 89 days since the December 12, 2003, drawing that produced one ticket worth $175,000 for matching five numbers. The ticket was purchased in Brownsville, and as of today, no one has come forward to claim the prize. The ticket was purchased at the Circle K #7085 at 1250 FM 802. "Players in Texas have 180 days after the date of a drawing to claim their prizes," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We've almost reached the half way point on the Mega Millions ticket sold in Brownsville, and we have three more sold in south Texas areas that are unclaimed, as well. We want those winners to step forward." Greer also wishes to alert the public that a Mega Millions ticket sold in El Paso for the December 26, 2003, drawing has 105 more days to claim that $175,000 prize. The ticket was purchase at 7-Eleven #613 at 6360 Airport Drive. Additionally, there are 109 days for two ticketholders to stake claim on the $175,000 prizes for tickets sold in Houston and McAllen for the December 30, 2003, drawing. The Houston ticket was purchased at R&R Food Mart at 7644 N. Gessner Drive, and the McAllen ticket was bought at the Town & Country store at 1921 N. 10th Street. There have been a total of 32 second tier prizewinners for the Texas Lottery® Mega Millions game. Of those, four have chosen to play the MegaplierTM game feature, and doubled, tripled or quadrupled their $175,000 prize. "Mega Millions has been very successful for the state," said Greer. "Players should know that out of each dollar their spending to play for a mega jackpot, 38 cents is being sent to the Foundation School Fund, to help pay for public education in Texas." Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $20 million.
