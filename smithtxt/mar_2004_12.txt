Cedar Park "Lucky Guy" Collects $175,000 Mega MillionsTM Prize

"I went to the Lottery Web site and found out that one of my tickets had won $175,000. I checked and re-checked for 30 minutes. I thought somebody was playing a joke on me."

(Austin, March 9) - Greg Galindo's friends say he is a lucky guy, always winning something. He proved them right when he won $175,000 after matching five numbers in the March 5 Mega MillionsTM drawing from the Texas Lottery®. The Round Rock native was on his way to a get-together with friends in Cedar Park when he stopped at the Big Diamond #1444, 901 Whitestone, and bought five Quick Pick tickets. "I put the tickets in my pocket and forgot about them. Later that night, around 2 a.m. I went to the Lottery Web site and found out that one of my tickets had won $175,000. I checked and re-checked for 30 minutes. I thought somebody was playing a joke on me." "It's no joke, Mr. Galindo really got to take home a big prize," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Like so many of our winners, Mr. Galindo suffered from the shock and disbelief that strikes instantly as the player realizes that the ticket in his hand is a winner; you can't believe your eyes. But, Mr. Galindo can believe this and he can take it to the bank." Galindo kept his ticket in a safe at home. He says he plans to pay off some bills. "And I also plan to keep on playing," he said. The jackpot for tonight's Mega Millions drawing is an estimated $13 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is worth and estimated $7 million.
