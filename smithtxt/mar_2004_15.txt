Texas Lottery Players Score Big In February
(Austin, March 5) - It was a big fat February for players of Texas Lottery games, with 19.3 million players taking home prizes that totaled more than $200 million. "It's true that 'You can't win if you don't play' and we had lots of players playing and winning last month," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission, which manages the Texas Lottery. "The $230 million Mega Millions jackpot certainly helped drive sales and create new winners, and our ever-popular instant tickets, such as Casino Action and Top Tens, also produced several top prize winners during the last four weeks." The numbers of winners per game and the total prize payout for February are listed below.
