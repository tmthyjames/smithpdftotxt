Mega MillionsTM Players Win On "Super Tuesday" - Collect On "Superior Thursday"
(Austin, March 4) - While Super Tuesday means a lot of clamoring with the politicos around the nation, it means something else entirely to players of the Texas Lottery® Mega MillionsTM game. It means a chance at big money, and on Tuesday, March 2, it meant $175,000 to two ticket holders in the Lone Star State. "I imagine that politics wasn't on the minds of our Mega Millions players on Tuesday. More like wanting to win a piece of that $20 million jackpot," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We didn't get a Texas jackpot winner, but I think our two $175,000 winners are thinking about what they can do with all of their prize money." Today, Victoria Sanchez of Grand Prairie gets to start thinking about her plans for her prize. Sanchez held one of the two tickets sold for Tuesday's drawing. She purchased her ticket at Doc's Beverage, located at 1103 East Ennis Avenue in Ennis. "Pay bills," Sanchez said. "And my granddaughter asked if she could have a computer. I think I can manage that." The second ticket was purchased in New Braunfels at the Pit Stop Food Mart #14, at 2204 N. Highway 46. The winner redeemed his ticket at the Texas Lottery San Antonio Claim Center this morning. The numbers drawn were: 25 - 50 - 30 - 35 - 40 and the gold Mega Ball was 4. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
