Love For Texas Lottery® Scratch Off Games Pays Big For San Antonio Player

Ester Huron of San Antonio "points" out her love of Texas Lottery Scratch Games!

(Austin, March 1) - Ester Huron of San Antonio loves when new Texas Lottery® scratch off games come out. According to Huron, it doesn't matter if they cost $1, $2 or $10, as in the case of the TOP TENS instant game. She particularly likes that game now since today she collected its top prize - $100,000. "I've never won so much money in my life," Huron said. "I love to play scratch off games, especially when they're fairly new. This is going to take me a long way." Huron bought her ticket at Diamond Shamrock #1046, located at 12020 O'Conner Road in San Antonio. She explained that her boyfriend and she had stopped to buy gas, and she had two of the TOP TENS games to redeem, worth $10 each. "I was just going to put the whole $20 toward gas, but my boyfriend kept telling me to just put half and get another game," she said. "I went inside and he waited at the pump. I was in there for a long time, and he finally came and said, 'Ester, it's cold and rainy outside, what's taking you so long?' I had to explain to him that I had bought another ticket and had just won $100,000." "That kind of cash prize can certainly warm up anyone," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Congratulations to Ms. Huron on her win, and thanks for being such an enthusiastic fan of the Texas Lottery scratch off games." Huron said she has special plans for her money. Along with finishing up some home repairs and helping her son pay for a little of his college tuition, she also has to make a visit to the local dentist. "I have to have some dental work done, and that can be so expensive. Now I can do it and I don't think I'll even feel the pain."
