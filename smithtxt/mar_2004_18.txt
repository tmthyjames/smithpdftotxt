Fort Worth Woman Wins Ticket's Top Prize Playing Instant Game $2,000,000 Spectacular
(Austin, March 1) - Ramona Cribbs of Fort Worth today collected the top prize of $2 million playing $2,000,000 Spectacular, a Texas Lottery® instant game. The $20 ticket pays a lump-sum of $2 million before the 25 percent federal tax is excised. Cribbs is the first claimant to come forward to claim one of the three top prizes available. The game was issued in late October of 2003. "This is the third $20 game we've issued, and just like the others, it has proven to be a real success," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Mrs. Cribbs says she might celebrate in a few days, and we're hoping she does because there's a whole lot of fun to be had with a prize of $2 million." For selling the ticket, Albertson's #4151 is eligible to receive a bonus of $10,000. The store is located at 4400 Western Center in Fort Worth. The Texas Lottery has issued 449 instant tickets since it issued its first ticket in May of 1992. The winner requested minimum publicity. The jackpot for Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM drawing is an estimated $20 million. Wednesday's Lotto TexasTM jackpot is an estimated $5 million.
