Fiesta Mart #17 of Houston Among 12 Retail Outlets Registering The Big Number -$10 Million Or Greater In Sales
(Austin, May 30) - - As part of the Texas Lottery Commission's 10-year anniversary, the agency honored 12 retail outlets whose sales reached or exceeded the $10 million mark since each of them sold their first ticket on May 29, 1992. Fiesta Mart #17, located at 4200 San Jacinto in Houston, had sales of $10 million.

"Reaching the $10 million sales mark is quite a feat," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud. "It takes ingenuity, persistence and perseverance, and the retail locations that have accomplished this sales milestone certainly deserve the recognition for the stellar selling job they've done." Eleven of the 12 retail locations honored were represented at a recognition dinner last night sponsored by the GTECH Corporation, the Lottery operator. Afterwards, the honorees visited the Texas Lottery studio to view a live Lotto Texas drawing. There are nearly 16,700 retail outlets that sell Texas Lottery products. All the honorees have had consistently high ticket sales every year. The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is $16 million. ... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time". By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the TLC has generated more than $9.4 billion for the state and paid more than $15 billion to players in prizes.
