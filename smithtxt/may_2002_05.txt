Mission's United Drive In Among 12 Retail Outlets Registering The Big Number -$10 Million Or Greater In Sales
(Austin, May 30) - - As part of the Texas Lottery Commission's 10-year anniversary, the agency honored 12 retail outlets whose sales reached or exceeded the $10 million mark since each of them sold their first ticket on May 29, 1992. United Drive In, located at 111 East Griffen Parkway in Mission, registered $16.7 million, the fourth highest sales.

"Reaching the $10 million sales mark is quite a feat," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud. "It takes ingenuity, persistence and perseverance, and the retail locations that have accomplished this sales milestone certainly deserve the recognition for the stellar selling job they've done." Eleven of the 12 retail locations honored were represented at a recognition dinner last night sponsored by the GTECH Corporation, the Lottery operator. Afterwards, the honorees visited the Texas Lottery studio to view a live Lotto Texas drawing. There are nearly 16,700 retail outlets that sell Texas Lottery products. All the honorees have had consistently high ticket sales every year. The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is $16 million.
