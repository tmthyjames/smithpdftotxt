"I was listening to KFZX radio (102.1 FM, Odessa) and they were having a contest to win some of the Harley® tickets," Hawkins explained. "I knew the answer, and won five tickets. I was playing to win one of those motorcycles." Hawkins asked her brother to pick the tickets up for her from the station. She waited until the next morning to scratch the tickets before she left for work. "It was the second ticket, and I couldn't believe I had won," she said. "I asked my brother if what I was seeing was true. He took it down to a retailer to get it verified, came back home afterward and told me, 'I was definitely a biker chick now.'" Hawkins is the second woman to win a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle in the Midland/Odessa area from the new scratchoff game. Dasha Moon of Midland will be receiving the keys to her new Harley® on Thursday, May 30. Moon will pick-up her Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 Custom Guy W's Harley-Davidson® dealership, located at 12100 West Highway 80 East.
