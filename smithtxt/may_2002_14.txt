Texas Lottery Celebrating "10 Years Of Winning For Texas"
(Austin, May 28) - - Where were some Texans 10 years ago? On May 29, 1992, most of them were in their local convenience and grocery stores buying up the first Texas Lottery instant ticket, Lone Star Millions. That's right -- it's been 10 years since the startup of the "winning" relationship between the Texas Lottery, it's lottery retailers and the players of the 'Games of Texas.' "It's been an exciting ride for the Texas Lottery Commission," said Linda Cloud, Executive Director. "In 10 years, we've awarded players more than $14 billion in prizes, paid more than $48 million in retailer bonuses, and contributed more than $9 billion to the State of Texas." The Texas Lottery's launch broke California's earlier track record by almost $2 million for the highest total sales startup -$23.2 million. The first week of the launch also recorded the highest number of tickets sold in the first week, 102.4 million, compared to the old record set by Florida of 95 million. Since those first record-shattering days when the Texas Lottery only sold scratch-off games, there have been five on-line additions to the 'Games of Texas' -- Lotto Texas in November 1992; Pick 3, October 1993; Cash 5, October 1995; Texas Million, May 1998; and Texas Two Step, May 2001.

"We're not through setting new records yet," said Cloud. "We've already began by breaking the former sales record for the popular Harley-Davidson® instant game theme. One-month ticket sales for the lottery's hottest new scratch-off have exceeded $12.5 million. That breaks the former record held by California, which posted sales of $9 million." The Texas Lottery is already focusing its attention to the next 10 years. On Monday, May 27, the first modification in 10 years to the lottery's nightly lineup of games began with the drawing time change to 10:12 p.m. The new daytime drawing for Pick 3, at 12:27 p.m., began on April 29, 2002, with great enthusiasm from players and impressive first week sales. In late July 2002, the Texas Lottery will also introduce several enhancements to the Cash 5 on-line game, and in the fall of 2002, the Texas Lottery is bringing back the popular instant ticket Bucks N Trucks.
