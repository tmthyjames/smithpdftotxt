Family Doesn't Need Any Convincing Of $22 Million Lotto Texas Win
(Austin, May 24) - - It only took Glenn Creswell of Denison a few moments to convince his wife and other family members they had won the $22 million Lotto Texas jackpot prize from the drawing held on May 15. The eight member group, CreswellClan, JV, claimed the jackpot prize today and will take home $12,117,133.60. The jackpot-winning ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, which pays out approximately half of the estimated jackpot. "I'm not the kind to joke around," Creswell said. "I told them all, 'We won,' and they all believed me right away."

Creswell explained he was reading The Dallas Morning News the morning after the drawing, and saw there was a sole winning ticket for the Lotto Texas jackpot purchased in Howe. "Once I saw one person in Howe had won, I was pretty optimistic enough to know it was me. I figured I better get the tickets out of the pickup," he said. "I finished breakfast, read the numbers, cleaned up my mess, and then went and woke up the family." Creswell, purchased the winning Quick Pick ticket with money the group had won from a previous drawing. He purchased $46 worth of Quick Pick tickets. The matching 6-of-6 ticket purchased at Passport #47, located at 100 North Collins Freeway in Howe. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent or $220,000, for selling the winning Lotto ticket. When asked if he had any immediate plans, Creswell explained he retired from the construction industry right away. "I called my boss and told him, 'I won the lottery and I'm hanging it up.' I've been retired for six days now, and I've been trying to get to Austin all this time to collect our money. "We've bought some new cars and my wife and I are going to buy a new house," he added. "Beyond that, we haven't given it any thought, although I might get some traveling in and make it as far as Dallas some day."
