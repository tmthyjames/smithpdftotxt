Quick Pick Ticket Turns Out Some Lucky Lotto Texas Numbers
(Austin, May 10) - - You just never know which numbers are going to be selected every Wednesday and Saturday night for the Lotto Texas drawing. But, if you're like John Melton of Burkburnett, you don't want to take any chances. That's why Melton says he buys some tickets with numbers he's chosen, and then buys some extra Quick Pick tickets for good measure. And recently one of those Quick Pick tickets ended up with the winning six-number Lotto combination.

Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Linda Cloud presenting John and Barbara Melton of Burkburnett with a ceremonial presentation check in the amount of $4,726,901.

"I just had an urge to get some more tickets," Melton explained. "So I went and bought $7 worth of Quick Pick tickets. The first thing I noticed about the numbers I got was that one of them, 13, is one I pick myself on my other tickets. That's my lucky number." He bought the two Quick Picks on his grandson's six-month birthday, which just happens to be the same day as the Lotto Texas drawing when his ticket matched all six numbers drawn. The numbers were: 10-11-13-25-35-39. "Not only did he buy them on our grandson's birthday, but some of the other numbers had significance also," said Melton's wife, Barbara. The two explained that the number "10" was the day of Barbara's birthday - December 10. The number "11" was John's mother's birthday - March 11. The number "35" is the age of their youngest son, and the number "39" is the age of their oldest son. Melton explained when he read in the Wichita Falls Times Record News that one of two winning Lotto tickets had been sold in the Wichita Falls area, he recognized the retailer name and the numbers looked very familiar to him.

"At first when I read the paper I thought, 'I wish that had been me,' " said Melton. "Then I recognized the store name. I went out to my truck to get those Quick Pick tickets and look at the numbers. They were the same. I got real nervous and thought, 'This is for real.' " Melton said he called his wife at home and told her not to go anywhere. "I could tell something was up," she said. "When he got home, the first thing he asked was, 'what's the prettiest thing you've ever seen besides me?' I told him, 'Our grandson.' He then showed me the ticket and the newspaper and I didn't believe what I was seeing. He's always trying to pull tricks on me so I thought it was a joke." The two called their youngest son at home to tell him the good news, and their oldest son happened to be there also. "They told their dad that they would believe anything he ever told them now," said Barbara.

About 70 friends and family members came to Austin to help John and Barbara Melton celebrate receiving their $4.7 million Lotto Texas jackpot prize

Melton held one of the two jackpot-winning Lotto tickets from the drawing held April 24, 2002, worth an estimated $17 million. Today, about 70 of their closest friends traveled to Texas Lottery headquarters to help the CJ & BARBARA MELTON FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP celebrate their $4.7 million Lotto Texas jackpot prize. "You would've thought the whole town had won," Barbara said. "We're very fortunate that we have people who care so much for us. We have a lovely group of friends and we wanted to share this with everyone." The winning ticket was purchased at K-C Oil #6, located at 2906 Central Expressway in Wichita Falls. The retailer is eligible for a bonus of one-percent - $85,000 - for selling the jackpot-winning Lotto ticket. The other jackpot winning ticket was purchased in Paris at Food Fast #95, at 707 Bonham Street. The 17 members of the Sesame Solutions Lottery Trust claimed their $4.7 million prize on April 30. "I'm still having trouble believing it," Melton said. "It's so unreal, strange." The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is worth $18 million.
