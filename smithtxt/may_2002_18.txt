What Are The Odds? Food Fast #63 Sells Second Lotto Texas Jackpot Ticket, Receives Bonus Of $340,000
(Gun Barrel City, May 9) - - There are 16,700 Texas Lottery retailers. When one of them sells its first Lotto Texas jackpotwinning ticket, it's a noteworthy event.

When the same retailer sells a second jackpot winner, people all over the state take notice. It's so rare, it's happened only 11 times in Texas since the lottery was created. That was the case with Food Fast #63, 2209 W. Main, in Gun Barrel City in the northeastern part of the state. The fact that the store is in a town with a population of fewer than 4,000 makes the sale of the second Lotto Texas jackpot winner even more intriguing. Most recently, the store sold a $34 million winner for the drawing on April 6. "I was astonished," said Jay Misenheimer, general manager at Food Fast. "When I got the call from the district sales manager, I just didn't know what to say. The convenience store business is tough to be in right now, but this will help a lot because the bonus will be rolled right back into the business. And the fact is, that selling lottery tickets is certainly an important part of our business." Sale of the second jackpot-winner made news headlines in newspapers throughout the state. The store sold its first Lotto jackpot winner 53 weeks earlier, on March 28, 2001, when the jackpot was $26 million. The store received a $260,000 bonus. According to Misenheimer, the Food Fast chain of stores has 62 locations and in just over one year three of its franchises have sold a Lotto Texas jackpot winner. On April 24, the Food Fast #95 in Paris sold one of two Lotto jackpot winning tickets in a drawing with a $17 million prize.

TxLottery: News Release

This latest round of Lotto-based notoriety brings the Gun Barrel store a one-percent bonus of $340,000 for selling the big prizewinner. René McCoy, Texas Lottery Commission marketing specialist, presented Misenheimer with the check. "This just goes to show you, there's nothing unlucky about a place called Gun Barrel," McCoy said. "I'm very pleased to be back nearly one year to the day since I last presented Jay with his first retailer bonus check. But this time his second check is worth even more. Congratulations again, Jay, and perhaps the legend of your store's luck will keep your customers coming back to see if you can sell a third winning ticket here." Claimants have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim the prize. Gun Barrel City resident Bonnie J. Foster claimed her prize on Friday, May 2. The Lottery pays a bonus to any Lotto retailer who sells a 6-of-6 jackpot winning ticket, in accordance with Lottery procedures. The retailer bonus equals one percent of the jackpot won by the customer, not to exceed $500,000 per drawing. In addition to the check presentation, the store hosted a Lone Star Spin, the prize wheel game that store patrons can play, with a qualifying purchase, to win tee shirts, key chains, koozies and other Lottery merchandise. The estimated jackpot for Saturday's Lotto Texas drawing is $18 million.
