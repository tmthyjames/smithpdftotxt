Texas LotteryTM Celebrates 11th Anniversary - Instant Tickets Continue To Drive Sales
(Austin, May 28) - As the Texas Lottery celebrates its 11th anniversary tomorrow, sales of the first product it ever sold, instant tickets, continue to climb toward meeting projections for the second-best year in scratch-off sales. "Instant tickets have been the backbone of our sales since the Lottery sold its first ticket 11 years ago," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "In 11 years, total sales from all games through April 30th exceed $31.6 billion. In that time, the Texas Lottery has generated more than $10.5 billion for Texas with more than $5.3 billion of that going to education." Lone Star Millions was the first ticket offered by the Texas Lottery on May 29, 1992. Since then, the Lottery has issued in excess of 400 instant games which account for 61 percent of total sales since start-up. Scratch off tickets continue to be the most popular lottery game, and are now bringing in more than $40 million per week in sales. All that scratching has been good for players, too, Greer said. "Since the Lottery started, we've paid out about $17.7 billion in prizes," he said. "$11.5 billion of that has come from instant tickets, so I would say instants have done their part to generate fun and excitement for players and revenue for the State of Texas." Besides instants, the Lottery also has four on-line games, Pick 3, Cash Five, Texas Two Step and its flagship game, Lotto Texas. Another online game, Texas Million, ran from 1998 to 2001. The Texas Lottery hasn't done it alone, though. "With the help of more than 16,000 retailers around the state, we've brought the 'Games of Texas' to millions of players," said Greer. "We've created more than 400 millionaires and millions of winners who have taken home significant prizes. For their part, retailers have garnered nearly $50 million in retailer bonuses, too. I'd say, all in all, that's a pretty good show." The Texas Lottery's launch in 1992 broke California's earlier track record by almost $2 million for the highest total sales startup, $23.2 million. The first week of the launch also recorded the highest number of tickets sold in the first week, 102.4 million, compared to the old record set by Florida of 95 million. The Texas Lottery is currently ranked number four among the 41 U. S. lotteries and third in the amount of money generated for the state.
