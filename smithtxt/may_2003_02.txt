Newton Resident Wins In Texas LotteryTM Instant Game $1,000,000 Classic

Mark L. Roberts holds his ceremonial $1 million check. Joining him at the Texas Lottery Commission are his brother Frank and mother Anna.

(Austin, May 28) - Having been laid off about a week ago doesn't seem too upsetting to Newton resident Mark L. Roberts right now. Over Memorial Day weekend, Roberts made a quick trip into town for a few groceries and a few Texas Lottery tickets. He ended up $1,000,000 richer as a top-prize winner on $1,000,000 Classic, a Texas Lottery instant game. "Winning the lottery is good old-fashioned luck," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We're very pleased for Mark." Roberts said he has been lucky with this game before. "I bought a $1,000,000 Classic ticket about three or four weeks ago and I won $40 on that first one," said Roberts. "It was stolen at work before I got to cash it in, but it was enough for me to try the game again. I'm glad. I got laid off six days ago." Roberts said that to lift his spirits, his brother, Frank, convinced him and their mother, Anna, to drive with him to the grocery store and then to Eagles for a few lottery tickets for Saturday night's Lotto Texas drawing for $23 million. "I bought two of these $1,000,000 Classic tickets," said Roberts. He began scratching his tickets in the car while Frank drove them home. "We were only half a mile down the road and he said to me 'I think I got a winner,'" explained Frank Roberts. "I pulled over and told him I wouldn't believe it until I saw it, and then when I looked at the ticket, I said I still was not going to believe it until the store clerk scanned it." "Sure enough, the clerk's readout said it was a winner and the store had insufficient funds to pay!" described Mark Roberts, 43.

"I couldn't sleep. I went to bed last night at 10 p.m. and it was after midnight before I got to sleep." Both Roberts and his brother were laid off from Triple S Construction, but know that they'll be called in as soon as there's work. Roberts said it's not unusual to work on and off in their line of work. The $1,000,000 Classic instant game started April 23 and more than 1.4 million of these $20 tickets have already been sold. Roberts won the second of the five $1-million dollar prizes. Eagles, located at Highway 190 South, 1100 feet west of Interstate Highway 87 in Newton, is eligible to receive a $10,000 retail bonus for selling one of the top prize-winning tickets in this instant game. Eagles also sold a Cash FiveTM winning ticket valued at $39,912 for the March 29 Cash Five drawing. Roberts, joined by his brother and his mother, flew to Austin on Tuesday to claim his prize of $1,000,000 before taxes at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters. He said he has already decided what to do with his winnings. "I want to pay off my car first, then buy a pickup -- a brand spanking new one with enough room for three: Frank, me, and my mother. And Mom's going to get a new trailer. Plus, we're going to do some work on our land, including moving some Chinaberry trees to plant thornless blackberry bushes. We want to sell blackberries." The Texas Lottery currently has four instant games that offer prizes of $1 million or more: $1,000,000 Classic, Twice As Grand, Weekly Grand and Holiday Million.
