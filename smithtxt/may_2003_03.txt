Freeway Construction Worker Detours To Collect $30,000 From Texas LotteryTM

Alex Duran holds his $30,000 prize from the Texas Lottery's Break the Bank scratch-off game.

(Austin, May 22) - Littlefield resident, Alex Duran, had to make a short detour on Monday, May 19, before beginning his work on the Marsha Sharp Freeway construction project. "I told my foreman that I needed a little extra time this morning and he asked, 'Why?' " Duran explained. "I told him that I had won $30,000 on a lottery ticket. All he said was, 'What are you still doing here?' " Duran won the $30,000 prize on the Texas LotteryTM Break the Bank scratch-off ticket. He told lottery officials the game was one of his favorites to play along with Weekly Grand, Bucks 'N Trucks II and Lotto TexasTM. "I'm putting some away (prize money) for my girls for school, and my wife and I have wanted to remodel our house for a long time, and now we can," Duran said. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer said he was very happy to hear about the lucky winner and his plans for the money. "The Texas Lottery's mission is to generate revenue for the state for public education, and it's gratifying to hear that one of our players is dedicating part of his winnings to the future education of his children," said Greer. BREAK THE BANK, one of the Texas Lottery's more popular instant tickets, has been issued a total of 11 times. Players win by matching YOUR NUMBERS to any one of the three LUCKY NUMBERS. If players get a "stack of bills" symbol, they win that cash prize automatically.
