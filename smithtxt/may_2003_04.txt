Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Presents $350,000 Bonus To Spring Retailer
(Spring, May 21) - Today, Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer presented a ceremonial bonus check for $350,000 to Karim Maknojia, owner of Spring Texaco, located at 5035 FM 2920, in Spring. The retail location sold the jackpot-winning Lotto TexasTM ticket for the drawing held on April 23, worth $35 million. "This is the second $350,000 bonus a Houston-area retailer has received in the last month," said Greer. "Both have been bonuses for selling winning tickets for two different $35 million Lotto Texas jackpots. That's a great boon to Houston retailers." Accepting the ceremonial check, Maknojia said learning he had sold the jackpot-winning ticket did not come as a big surprise. "On the day before the Wednesday drawing, I had a strong feeling, the first time in the four years I have owned this store, that we would be selling the winning ticket," recalled Maknojia. "I ran out to the parking lot to ask our sales representative what I should do if it turned out that we sold the ticket. It is so exciting, and I plan to give my employees a bonus, also." The winner of the $35 million jackpot, Spring Six Trust, of Kingwood, claimed its prize on May 6. The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option payment and earned the winner more than $21.8 million, before taxes. The Houston sales district area has 4,708 Texas LotteryTM retailers. Since lottery tickets first went on sale in May 1992, the total paid in lottery retailer bonuses for the area is $14,981,208.80. That total includes bonuses retailers earned for selling winning tickets for Lotto Texas, Texas Two StepTM, Cash FiveTM, and instant games that have a top prize valued at $1,000,000 or more. Retailers have earned more than $14.2 million in bonuses for selling 132 Lotto Texas jackpot-winning tickets. To date, Houston district retailers have accounted for more than $8.4 billion in sales, which represents approximately 30 percent of all lottery sales statewide, as of May 6, 2003. Houston sales district area retailers are responsible for nearly $802 million in sales during 2002, which is approximately 31 percent of the statewide total. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $20 million.
