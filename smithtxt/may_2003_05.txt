"I can't say enough good things about our 4,708 retailers in the Houston district," said Greer. "This area is responsible for nearly $802 million in sales during 2002, which is approximately 31 percent of the statewide total." The top retailer is Rudy's Stop and Shop, located at 1018 Damon St. in Rosenberg. The store registered total sales of $1,521,361.

The store is located at 3420 W. Orem in Houston. All awards were based on sales from calendar year 2002. The sales figures are unaudited. Since lottery tickets first went on sale in May of 1992, Houston district retailers have accounted for more than $8.4 billion in sales, which represents approximately 30 percent of all lottery sales statewide, as of May 6, 2003. Houston district retailers have earned more than $421.6 million in commissions. To date, the total paid in lottery retailer bonuses for the area is $14,981,208.80.
