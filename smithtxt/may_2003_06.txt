Texas Two StepTM Celebrates 2nd Anniversary With Million Dollar Winner From Beeville
(Austin, May 14) - It's been two years since Texans began kickin' up their heels with the Texas Lottery Commission's Texas Two Step game. Texas Two Step was added to the Lottery's lineup of on-line games in May 2001 and is drawn every Tuesday and Friday night. "Since 2001, more than five million winners have found out that Texas Two Step is easy to play and fun, to boot," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "In 2003 alone, we've had 13 jackpot winners including today's recipient, Richard W. Beasley, from Beeville, who collected $1 million, before taxes, from the drawing held on May 6." To date, the Texas LotteryTM has paid out more than $83 million to Texas Two Step winners. Of that amount, more than $38 million has been won at the jackpot prize level. Beasley, who randomly chose his numbers from a news publication, purchased his ticket at Circle K, located at 600 E. Houston Street in Beeville. The retail owner is eligible for a bonus of 1 percent - $10,000 - for selling the jackpot winning ticket. The numbers drawn were: 07 - 29 - 30 - 14 and the Bonus Ball number was 23. "I like Texas Two Step a lot, because I like the odds," said Beasley. Players choose four numbers from a field of 35, and then choose a Bonus Ball number from another field of 35 numbers. Jackpots start at $200,000 and roll to a higher amount until a ticket or tickets match all four numbers and the Bonus Ball. Odds of winning the Texas Two Step jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million. Overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 32. "This is a once in a lifetime event," said Beasley. "I'm going to be a good custodian of this money. I'm very thankful and I appreciate this opportunity." Friday's Texas Two Step jackpot is worth $200,000.
