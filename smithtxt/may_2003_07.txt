(Austin, May 13) - William L. "Billy" Atkins, director of the Texas Lottery Commission's Charitable Bingo Operations Division, was elected 2004 vice president of the North American Gaming Regulators Association (NAGRA) during the organization's Spring Conference in Winnipeg, Canada. He will become president of the organization after his tenure as vice president ends in July 2004. "NAGRA has a great track record for its consistent efforts to develop standards for legislation and rules concerning gaming activities, and has certainly been a great help to the Texas Lottery Commission on a number of gaming questions," said Atkins. "I'm honored to have been elected vice president, and I look forward to helping NAGRA continue to grow and develop as a professional organization." Dale Fuga is the current president of NAGRA. He called Atkins' election "very positive" for the organization. "Billy is certainly a committed individual," he said. "He's co-chaired several NAGRA committees and provided leadership and valuable insight on numerous issues." Kay Gaines, tribal contributions manager at the Arizona Department of Gaming, will join Atkins in July when she takes the helm of NAGRA. "Billy has been a tremendous asset to NAGRA," she said. "His presence on the board will help to enhance our conferences." "I look forward to working with Kay and Dale on the many issues that NAGRA will be facing in the coming years." Said Atkins. NAGRA was established in 1984 and is made up of federal, state, local tribal and provincial government agencies that are responsible primarily for the regulation of legalized gaming activities. Those include charitable bingo, pull-tabs, lotteries, raffles and non-profit Las Vegas or casino nights used by nonprofit organizations for fund-raising activities. There are 120 member groups in NAGRA.
