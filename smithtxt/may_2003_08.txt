While Khatoon plans to pay off all her credit cards, she said she's also thinking of "maybe a little bit of fun, too." Scratch Off sales for the Texas Lottery have averaged $44 million per week for the last 24 weeks. Greer said the instant ticket line accounts for 73 percent of total lottery sales.
