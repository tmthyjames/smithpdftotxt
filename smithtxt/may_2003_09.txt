An Old Friend Has A New Twist - Lotto TexasTM Jackpots Could Reach Record Highs
(Austin, May 7) - It has the familiarity of an old friend, but with a fresh twist. It's the new Lotto TexasTM game with its bonus ball play style, and it could mean big bucks for Texas LotteryTM players across the state. Players could possibly see jackpots reach levels between $65 million and $100 million three to four times in a 52-week period. "It's a whole new ball game for the Texas Lottery's Lotto Texas game, and that means players have more chances to win and a chance to win higher-level jackpots," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "We've created a new game with eight prize tiers, and players' overall odds at winning any prize have improved to one in 57." Sales for the revamped game started Sunday, May 4, and the first drawing is tonight at 10:12 p.m., Central Standard Time. "We're anticipating a 25 percent increase in the number of overall winners because of the added bonus ball feature," Greer said. "We estimate that the State of Texas will also become a big winner with the amount of additional revenue the game could generate - more than $50 million in additional revenue during the first full fiscal year of sales." Along with the state, Texas Lottery retailers also stand to benefit from the changes with increased commissions from a rise in ticket sales. Players will choose five numbers from one field of 44 numbers, and then choose a Bonus Ball number from a second field of 44 numbers. The odds of winning the jackpot prize are 1 in 47.7 million. "Our sales figures confirm that players are speaking with their dollars and want to participate when the jackpot gets to a higher level," said Greer. "The new Lotto Texas game gives players what they told us they want - higher jackpots. We hope that players will try the new game." Players will continue to choose their jackpot payment options, either the Cash Value Option or 25-year annuity, at the time they purchase their Lotto Texas tickets. The cost to play is still $1. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth $9 million. Since the Texas Lottery began in 1992, more than $10.3 billion has been transferred to the State of Texas. FY '03 sales through April 30th are $2.1 billion, up 8.3% from FY '02 sales through April 30th of $1.9 billion.
