Pasadena Woman Scratches And Wins In Texas LotteryTM Instant Game $1,000,000 Classic

Posing with the $1 million ceremonial check are Randy Schiever, Sandy Schriever and Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer.

(Austin, May 6) - Millions of dollars have passed through the hands of Sandy Schriever, and she never got to keep any of it, until now. The Pasadena resident won $1 million playing $1,000,000 Classic, a Texas Lottery instant game. "I worked at the Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas for 17 years, mostly in the main cage, so I literally handled millions of dollars every day," Schriever said. "It went through my hands and back to the casino, though, so I never handled anything that went into my bank account, until today, that is." Schriever's prize came to $730,000, after taxes. "I have the best job around, I get to give away money," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "I was talking about this very ticket this morning at our agency staff meeting, and just hours later, I get to award the top prize to Sandy Schriever from Pasadena." Greer noted that Schriever won the first of the five $1-million-dollar prizes the game awards. Schriever said she bought one $1,000,000 Classic at Brownie's Grocery in Deer Park last Friday and sat in her car while she scratched the ticket. "Just to make sure that what I was looking at was real, I made the clerk come sit with me in the car and look at the ticket," she said. "He told me it was the real thing, $1 million." Schriever said she went to her grandson's T-Ball game and kept opening her purse to look at the oversized ticket. She also went to two other stores afterwards with a copy of the ticket to ask if the clerks thought it was real. "I kept my husband up almost all night talking about the ticket," she said. "The next day I went back to the store where I bought

the ticket and heard two men in there bragging to anybody who would listen, including me, about how they were in the store when the woman bought the $1 million ticket. All I could say to them was 'Really?' " The store, Brownie's Grocery, placed a copy of the winning ticket on the register for customers to see. Brownie's is located at 1301 Pasadena Boulevard, and is eligible to receive a retailer bonus of $10,000 for selling one of the top prize-winning tickets in the game. Schriever said her prize will allow her to retire soon from her bookkeeping job at the Texas Chiropractic Clinic in Pasadena. She said she may buy a car, but hasn't thought beyond taking her grandchildren to Disney World in June. She also plans to volunteer at a local hospital. Randy, her husband, will not retire from his job at a local beverage distributorship. "I also dee-jay at weddings, and generally have a lot of fun," he said. "Besides, we really have to save our money for retirement instead of going through it." Luck seems to run in the family. Randy said his father won $73,000 playing Cash 5 in 1996. "He gave each of his four children $1,000 as our share," he said. "My sister called me and reminded me that our parents were about to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary, so we gave them a big party. I don't think he ever realized he paid for his own party." The Texas Lottery currently has four instant games that offer prizes of $1 million or more: $1,000,000 Classic, Twice As Grand, Weekly Grand and Holiday Million.
