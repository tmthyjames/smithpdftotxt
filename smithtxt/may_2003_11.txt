$35 Million Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Claimed By Spring Six Trust
(Austin, May 6) - Today, the last jackpot winner from the old 6-of-54 Lotto Texas game claimed the $35 million jackpot from the drawing on April 23. The jackpot was claimed by Spring Six Trust, which was represented by Harry E. Clemonds, trustee. Clemonds presented the winning ticket at Texas Lottery Commission headquarters in Austin. The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, making the prize worth $21,883,966, before taxes. "The Spring Six Trust has earned a spot in Lotto Texas history," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "This group of players won the last big jackpot using the 6-of-54 matrix," Greer explained. "They're a good example of the fun you can have playing Lotto Texas as a group." The trust, from Kingwood, is made up of a group of friends who began playing the game with ten sets of numbers about a year ago. Each member of the group chose numbers from a jar to create the sets. "Some of us were just sitting around one day and decided to go in together on the Lotto Texas drawings," said Clemonds. "It just seemed like a fun thing to do at the time." It was Clemonds' responsibility to buy the tickets, but he changed his routine a bit for this drawing. "I usually buy our tickets somewhere in Houston, but this time I stopped to buy gas in Spring, and it was a spur of a moment decision to go ahead and buy our tickets a day early," he explained. "Now I feel like I'm going to wake up out of a dream." Spring Texaco, located at 5035 FM 2920, in Spring, sold the winning ticket. The retailer is eligible to receive a 1 percent bonus of $350,000 for selling the jackpot-winning ticket. The numbers that matched all six-of-six for the jackpot that were chosen by the group members were: 22 - 11 - 33 - 32 - 1 - 2. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $9 million. It will be the first drawing using the new Bonus Ball matrix. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
