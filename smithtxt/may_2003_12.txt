Out With The Old, In With The New? For Lotto TexasTM, It's A Whole New Ball GameTM
(Austin, May 2) - It's the oldest on-line game the Texas LotteryTM has, and in just a few days, it will be a whole new ball game. Saturday's drawing will be the last that uses a 6-of-54 matrix, where players have to match 6 of 6 numbers to win the jackpot. As that play-style exits, It's a Whole New Ball GameTM for Lotto Texas. "Since it began, our flagship game has produced 474 winners through April 1. Lotto Texas has created millionaires in the Lone Star state, neighboring states and even other countries," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan Greer said. "With the possibility of jackpots reaching between $65 million and $100 million and better overall odds of winning a prize, we anticipate players are going to be very enthusiastic about the new Lotto Texas game." Lotto Texas has always been the most popular of the Texas Lottery's on-line games since sales started on November 7, 1992, eight weeks ahead of schedule. The first Lotto drawing was held at 9:59 p.m. on Wednesday, November 14. In the original matrix, Lotto players chose 6 of 50 numbers. When the matrix changed in July 2000, players then chose 6 numbers from a field of 54. Sales begin Sunday for Lotto Texas in its new configuration, with the first drawing set for Wednesday, May 7. Players will choose 5 numbers from one field of 44 and a Bonus Ball number from a second field of 44. When the balls drop for the last time Saturday in the 6-of-54 game, the Lotto Texas jackpot will be worth an estimated $7 million.
