It's All About Celebrating The Largest Jackpot And The 12th Anniversary At The Texas Lottery®
(Austin, May 28) - It's a "throwing-your-hat-up-in-the-air" type of celebration at the Texas Lottery®. Not only are we marking the 12th Anniversary of the Texas Lottery this weekend (May 29), we also get to boast the largest jackpot in the nation with Lotto TexasTM worth an estimated $70 million. "What a way to mark this year," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "As Lottery players across the state get ready for an extra long weekend, we want to make sure everyone is aware that we're offering the largest jackpot anywhere in the United States right now." With Saturdays typically being the higher sales day for Lotto Texas, Greer wanted to urge players to get their tickets early and beat the lines at Lottery retail locations. "We're also celebrating our twelve-year anniversary of when we started generating revenue for the State of Texas," said Greer. "Tack on the fact we've paid winners over the years more than $19.7 billion*, the amount retailers have earned in bonuses, more than $53 million*, and all the exciting games we've created, and you have one big reason to celebrate." Since the Texas Lottery began on May 29, 1992, total sales have equaled $35.1 billion* and total retailer commissions have totaled $1.8 billion*. Total transfers to the state equal more than $11.4 billion**, of which $6.2 billion** has been transferred to the Foundation School Fund, which helps pay for public education in Texas. Tonight's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $42 million and the Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $325,000.
