$11,414,893,108
(Austin, May 26) - It's a big number - $11,414,893,108. No idea what it stands for? Need a hint? For Texans and retailers across the state, it epitomizes the 12-year relationship with the Texas Lottery Commission, which began May 29, 1992, with the first scratch-off game, Lone Star Millions. "We're about to mark the twelve-year anniversary of when we started generating revenue for the State of Texas," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Tack onto that number all the happy smiles from our winners and retailers, all the prizes we've given out and all the exciting games we've created, and you have one big reason to celebrate." Through April 30, 2004, the Texas Lottery Commission has paid out $19,590,973,761 in prizes to winners statewide, sent more than $6.2 billion to the Foundation School Fund, and handed out more than 100 keys for brand new pickup trucks and motorcycles to instant ticket winners. Lottery retailers have earned more than $57 million in bonuses for selling jackpot/topprize winning on-line tickets and some instant tickets. "Over the past several years, the Texas Lottery Commission has really had a lot to boast about," Greer noted. "We've seen a steady increase in total sales for the past four years, and we believe the rest of this fiscal year will prove to be just as rewarding. Our goal is to exceed last year's sales of $3.1 billion." Last year marked a historical one for the Lottery as Texas joined the multi-state Mega MillionsTM game. In addition to the chance at winning huge jackpots, players were given the opportunity to double, triple or quadruple non-grand/jackpot prizes by playing Texas' little twist on the game - the MegaplierTM. Since December 2003, the Megaplier feature alone has generated more than $27 million in total sales. Listed below are 12 additional Lottery highlights that have taken place since startup in 1992:
