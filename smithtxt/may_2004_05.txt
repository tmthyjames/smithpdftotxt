Lotto TexasTM Jackpot Alert!!!!
(Austin, May 20) - The current Lotto TexasTM jackpot, an estimated $61 million, is the highest jackpot in the nation. Sales for last night's drawing, worth $57 million, totaled $5.2 million. "Lotto Texas continues to produce strong sales, and we anticipate Saturday night's estimated jackpot will give players that 'Lotto Fever'," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Lottery retailers will most likely see an upswing in sales starting tomorrow and into Saturday, which is typically our highest Lotto sales day." The last time the jackpot reached levels of more than $50 million was for the drawing held on January 31, which was worth an advertised $70 million. One ticket sold in Houston matched all five numbers and the Bonus Ball. The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option payment, and was worth $42.8 million, before taxes. Heliodoro Cuenca claimed the prize on February 19. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
