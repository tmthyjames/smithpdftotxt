Texas Lottery® Player Says the Reason He Plays Mega MillionsTM Is Because Of MegaplierTM

Gerald LeBlanc of Winnie used the Megaplier feature to triple his $175,000 Mega Millions prize and collect $525,000 instead.

(Austin, May 19) - Gerald LeBlanc of Winnie has a pretty simple reason for why he likes to play the Mega MillionsTM game. "I wouldn't play if I didn't have the chance to at least double my prizes," he said. And that was reason enough for him to buy $10 worth of tickets for the Friday, May 14, drawing, and play the MegaplierTM feature for each of his tries, spending a total of $20. "I chose my own numbers," said LeBlanc. "I cut them out of the paper and then picked them out. I've played the same set for about three weeks now." He stopped Saturday morning at the retail location where he purchased his tickets to pickup the drawing results. He looked briefly at the numbers, and noted that the Mega Ball was a 'six.' "I remembered seeing a six as one of my numbers, but didn't check until much later. When I finally looked over all my numbers, I had one line that did match the Mega Ball number, but it wasn't until the last line of my second ticket that I saw I had matched the other five," he explained. "I just kept saying, 'There's no way, there's no way." "Mr. LeBlanc certainly found his way to winning more than half a million dollars because he likes the Megaplier game feature," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "By choosing to Megaply, his $175,000 prize

turned into a $525,000 one. He is the eighth winner in Texas to increase the second tier prize amount because he Megaplied his purchase." LeBlanc purchased his winning ticket at Finley's #2, located at 4619 FM 565 South in Baytown. The Mega Millions numbers drawn for Friday night were: 10 - 32 - 36 - 19 - 46 and the Mega Ball number was 6. The Megaplier number was 3. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $26 million. "I'm trying to win that jackpot," LeBlanc said. "I know my way to Austin pretty well if I do."
