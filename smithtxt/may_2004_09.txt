Texas Lottery $130,000 Bonus Scratch Game Winner Collects
(Austin, May 17) - For the second time in 10 days, someone has collected the top prize of $130,000 in one of the newest instant games from the Texas Lottery®, $130,000 Bonus. Nam Van Nguyen of Fort Worth on Friday became the second top prize winner in this game that was issued in April. Speaking through an interpreter who happens to be his daughter, Thao, Nguyen said, "I bought the ticket at a 7-Eleven in Arlington and scratched it right away. I knew I won." Nguyen's daughter traveled 27 hours by bus from California to help her father with the process of claiming his prize. He said he plans to pay off his bills and help his children. "With this money, I can help pay off our house and pay for my children's education," he said. "I also plan to keep playing because someday I hope to win $1 million." "With this kind of prize, $500 per week for five years, it's as if you win every week," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "This game's success is a big indicator that scratch-offs like this one with a prize that's paid out over time are a hit with our players. This game shot out of the gate only in April and already it's got three of the five top prizes claimed." Two top cash prizes remain unclaimed for the $130,000 Bonus game. The game has more than 1 million other prizes of $1000, $500, $100, $75, $50, $30, $15, $10 and $5. Mr. Nguyen bought his ticket at a 7-Eleven store, #1631-25259, located at 700 I-20 in Arlington. "I want to congratulate every lottery winner," Nguyen said. "I know how they feel."
