$175,000 Mega MillionsTM Prize Still Waiting On Owner To Come Forward
(Austin, May 10) - Since December 5, 2003, the first Mega MillionsTM drawing date, a total of 41 tickets have matched numbers for the $175,000 cash prize. Most of those ticket holders didn't waste any time to claim their prizes, but one ticket is starting to garner a little worry. "No one has come forward with the $175,000 Mega Millions ticket bought in Brownsville for the December 12 drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The ticket was the second one in Texas to match five numbers for that prize level, and we would really like to meet that ticket holder. The last day to claim this prize is June 9." The ticket was purchased at the Circle K #7085, located at 1250 FM 802. The winning numbers drawn for the December 12 Mega Millions drawing were: 09 - 16 - 32 - 45 - 46 and the Mega Ball number was 26. "It's been a remarkable five months for the Texas Lottery Commission with the addition of Mega Millions," said Greer. "We're on track to surpass last year's sales totals, we're giving players games they're excited about, and sending more money to the Foundation School Fund to help pay for education in Texas." Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot is worth an estimated $10 million.
