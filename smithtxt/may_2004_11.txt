Bryan Man Wins Top Cash Prize For Texas Lottery® $130,000 Bonus Scratch Game

Timothy Driver is the second winner to receive the top-cash prize of the Texas Lottery $130,000 Bonus scratch off game.

(Austin, May 7) - Timothy Dion Driver of Bryan today became the second winner of the Texas Lottery® $130,000 Bonus scratch off game. The popular instant ticket allows players the chance to win $500 a week for five years for a total of $130,000, before taxes. "I bought one ten-dollar ticket and won fifty dollars, so I turned it around and told the clerk to give me one of those new fivedollar games ($130,000 Bonus)," said Driver. "I scratched it there, saw I'd won, and left. I took it back the next day and showed them the ticket." Driver purchased his top-prize winning ticket at the Yegua Food Store, located at 17393 SH 36 South in Somerville. The $130,000 Bonus game has overall odds of winning any prize of 1 in 4.42, including break-even prizes. "Sales for the $130,000 Bonus game have totaled more than $2 million per week since it started on April 21," said Texas Lottery Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Players seem to really enjoy the game's payout option, and we're excited about meeting all the big winners. There are still three more top prizes left to claim." Other cash prizes for the game are: $1000, $500, $100, $75, $50, $30, $15, $10 and $5. "My favorite scratch off is $2,000,000 Spectacular," said Driver. "I'm still looking for that two-million-dollar prize."
