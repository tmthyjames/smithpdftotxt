Texas Two Step® Jackpot Closes In On 180th Day To Claim
(Austin, May 6) - Friday, May 7, will mark the 150th day that a Texas Two Step® jackpot-winning ticket has remained unclaimed. The ticket, sold for the drawing held on December 9, 2003, is worth $325,000, before taxes. "The final day to claim this Two Step jackpot prize will be Friday, June 4," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The ticket holder may cash the ticket in at the Texas Lottery Corpus Christi Claim Center. He or she must be there by 5 p.m." The jackpot-winning ticket was purchased at the Circle K #52146, located at 2882 Main Street in Ingleside. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $3,250 for selling the winning Texas Two Step ticket. If the ticket is not redeemed, it will mark the third time a Texas Two Step jackpot has gone unclaimed. "If anyone out there has this ticket, we want you to come forward," said Greer. "As of April 27th, the Texas Lottery has paid Texas Two Step jackpots to 131 winners. I'd like to see that number go up by one more, and that means finding that ticket." As of April 30, 2004, sales for Texas Two Step, which launched in May 2001, have totaled $223,829,620. The game has paid out more than $108 million in cash prizes in the same time period.
