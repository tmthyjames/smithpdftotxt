Lottery Player Scratches At Bingo Hall - Wins $30,000
(Austin, November 22) - Patti Andrus of San Antonio took a quick "spin" to a Texas Lottery retailer because she was running early to her Bingo game. She ended up having to make a trip to the lottery's San Antonio Claim Center, too, because she won the top cash prize, $30,000, on the Texas Lottery's Spin & Win Scratch-Off game. "I was on my way to play Bingo, and stopped to buy four Spin & Win tickets," Andrus explained. "I was running early, so I stopped again at a Texaco station and bought three more. When I got to the hall, I started scratching, and saw the money bag symbol. I was in total shock. It took about six people to tell me that I had won." Andrus said everyone around her was very happy for her win. She said she plans on having a very special Christmas, and putting some of the money in a savings account. Players can win up to $30,000 by playing the Texas Lottery's Spin & Win Scratch-Off game. To win, players scratch and match any one of YOUR NUMBERS to any one of the three LUCKY NUMBERS, and win the prize shown. If a "money bag" symbol shows, players win that prize automatically. "I've won $200 on Spin & Win once before, and most of the $2 games are my favorite," said Andrus. "I would never have dreamed this would happen to me, but it did." To date, the Texas Lottery Commission's instant ticket sales have totaled more than $17 billion. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
