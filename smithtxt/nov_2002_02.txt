(Austin, November 22) - Daniel Fritz of Brenham gave his wife a real shock. The couple celebrated their wedding anniversary yesterday, and Fritz won $77,000 today on the Texas Lottery's scratch-off game, SUPER LUCKY 7's. "I gave her the winning ticket in one of the lottery's holiday envelopes and told her, 'Happy Anniversary,' " Fritz explained. "When she opened it she thought it was a fake ticket and got mad at me. After I finally convinced her it was real, she started screaming and crying." Fritz purchased his $77,000 winning SUPER LUCKY 7's ticket at Juds #2, located at 1900 South Market in Brenham. "I went in to buy any ticket that was more than $3.00," Fritz said. "I bought one $10 ticket, two $5 tickets, and one $7 ticket, the SUPER LUCKY 7's. I took them out to my truck and when I scratched the first ticket, I didn't get anything. Then I scratched the LUCKY 7's ticket and saw that I had won 11 times. I went back and scratched off the dollar amount. "I just froze up and started shaking. I couldn't even hold my quarter very well to scratch-off the other two tickets." Fritz said he went back inside the retail location and let the clerk verify his ticket was a winner. "She just about passed out, too," he said. Fritz told officials he and his wife are going to pay off some bills and get a new car for her. He also mentioned that the two plan on spoiling their children a little this Christmas. Saturday's estimated Lotto Texas jackpot is $9 million.
