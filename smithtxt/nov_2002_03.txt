Retailer Gets Early Holiday Gift - Wins $100,000 From The Texas Lottery's Instant Game, Home For The Holidays

$100,000 winner Lee Roy Reininger of Poth.

(Austin, November 20) - A holiday gift came early this year for one central Texan. Lee Roy Reininger of Poth took home $100,000, the top cash prize from one of the Texas Lottery's newest holiday instant games - Home for the Holidays. "I scratched it Friday morning with a friend of mine standing there with me," said Reininger. "I didn't think I had won that much at first, but my friend kept saying, 'You got a winner. "I always tell people, 'The $10 tickets are real good winners.' Now, I plan on buying a new truck, pay off some bills and put the rest in a special account. My play money account." Reininger purchased his top prize winning ticket at Lee Roy's One Stop in Poth, which is approximately 37 miles south of San Antonio. He has owned and operated the store for 34 years and has been a lottery retailer for more than six years. He explained to lottery officials the secret of his lottery business success. "I hang up all the winning tickets, from $50 on up, so people can see all the winners that come here," Reininger said. "A lot of people stop and look at them. "Lots of times if it's really slow, I'll scratch some lottery tickets until I get a winner. Good things come to those who wait," he explained. "And those who play the Texas Lottery's Scratch-Offs." Players can win up to 23 times on Home for the Holidays. The ticket costs $10, with a top cash prize of $100,000. There are three $100,000 and eight $10,000 cash prizes left in the game. Reininger also said he's anxiously awaiting the new $20 Texas Lottery scratch-off game, Holiday Millions.
