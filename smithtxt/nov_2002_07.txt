Two Texas Cities Play A Part In Texas Two StepTM Winner's Story

Maria Oviedo smiles after she claims her share of the $575,000 Texas Two Step jackpot prize.

(Austin, November 8) - Houston gets to chalk up a Texas Two Step claimant to its long list of winners, and Brownsville gets to lay claim to selling the jackpot winning ticket to that lucky person. Today, Maria Oviedo claimed her share of the $575,000 jackpot prize at the Texas Lottery Commission's Claim Center in Harlingen. Oviedo's nephew, Geraldo Bedraza, drove her into Harlingen this morning. "We were visiting her sister and my mother-in-law last weekend," Bedraza explained. "She left the ticket at her sister's house, and they had to call her and tell her that she had won. She made me drive her back down here on my day off. I told her I was going to charge her, but I was just playing around." According to Bedraza, his aunt said she wants to help some family members and pay off some debts. "This came at just the right moment," he said. "It's a good Thanksgiving present." Oviedo's winning ticket was one of three that matched all four numbers plus the bonus ball in Tuesday's Texas Two Step drawing. The retailer, Circle K #9793, at 1544 Palm Boulevard, is eligible to receive a bonus of $1,916.66 for selling the winning ticket. The other two winning tickets were sold in Odessa and Richardson. Marcella Sutton of Odessa claimed her part of the prize yesterday. Sutton purchased her ticket at Amigos #23, located at 1201 N. Grant. Samson Bekele of Garland claimed his share on Wednesday, November 6. Bekele purchased his ticket at 7-Eleven, located at 2161 E. Arapaho in Richardson. Each of the retailers is also eligible for a bonus of $1,916.66. The jackpot for tonight's Texas Two Step drawing is worth $200,000.
