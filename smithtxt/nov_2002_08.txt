For One Winner, The Road To A Harley-Davidson® Went Through George West

Gary Holt, winner of a new Harley-Davidson® motorcycle.

(Austin, November 5) - The road to a new Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomTM motorcycle for Gary Holt was steep, at first. Last Friday, however, the road smoothed out when he bought a Texas Lottery Harley-Davidson® instant ticket when he stopped in George West and won the prize he'd been eyeing all year. "I called everybody I knew right after I won to tell them about the motorcycle," Holt said. "I've been looking at Harleys® all year. It's just strange how it happened that I wound up getting one when I wanted one as much as I did, but there it is. And, it's great." The 35-year-old Holt works for a gas pipeline company in Mission. He says a group of his friends have Harley-Davidson® motorcycles, which they ride together on weekends. "I've had other motorcycles in my life, but I really wanted a Harley®," he said. "My kids are pretty excited about it, too. They might get to go riding with their dad." Holt bought the hog-winner at Handi Stop #3, Highway 281 and 59 Bypass, in George West. Mackey Alvarez, manager of the two Handi Stop stores in the Southeast Texas town, said Holt got a jolt when he realized he won a motorcycle. "He was so thrilled, he was showing his ticket to anybody who walked in the store," she said. "He sounded like he was ready to ride, too." The Texas Lottery Commission has given away 27 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomTM motorcycles since the game began in May. Four of those prizes were won in second-chance drawings. Players can still mail in non-winning Harleyhttp://10.15.34.35/news/view_press_release.cfm?id=380 (1 of 2)12/12/2006 3:16:38 PM
