Texas Lottery® Holiday Scratch-Offs Make Gift-Giving Easy
(Austin, November 26) - The Texas Lottery® is making the holiday gift-giving this year a little easier for everyone. With a range of holiday-themed scratch-off games, and the $2,000,000 Spectacular instant game, players, or a loved one, could win a top cash prize from $20,000 up to $2 million. "We're offering a price range to fit anyone's need and the instant tickets are great as a stocking stuffer," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The holiday season is one of our highest sales periods. Last year, from October through December, sales for our instant tickets were more than $519 million. "We're already on track this year to surpass that number. As of November 22, average weekly instant ticket sales are up about seven percent," he stated. The Texas Lottery introduced three new holiday instant tickets to players and retailers on October 22. As of November 22, sales for the three games are more than $54 million. As of November 22, Winter Green, with a top cash prize of $20,000, has already produced six top prize winners and 23 winners who have won $2,000 each. Holiday Bonus, a $5 game, has a top prize of $150,000. There have been 17 players who've won the next prize level - $5,000. Holiday Countdown, a $10 game, pays $500,000 as the top prize, and three lucky players have cashed in on the next prize level and collected $10,000. "We also introduced our third $20 game, $2,000,000 Spectacular," said Greer. "It's the first scratch off game that allows players a chance to win $2 million and receive the prize in one lump sum." As of November 22, there have been 20 players who have won $20,000 on the game. Sales for $2,000,000 Spectacular total more than $22 million.
