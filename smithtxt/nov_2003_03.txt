Danny McCarroll of Forney plans to play more Cash Five after winning more than $15,000.

(Austin, November 24) - It could have been like any other day, with anyone's list of things to do. But Danny McCarroll of Forney didn't know his to-do list for Monday, November 17, was going to include winning a top cash-prize on the Texas Lottery® Cash FiveTM game. "I knew I had to stop by the bank in Rockwall, so while I was in town I decided to stop and buy a Cash Five Quick Pick," McCarroll said. "I usually choose my own numbers for all the games. "When I went to check my ticket and saw that I matched all five numbers, I just kept looking and looking and looking and looking," he said. McCarroll purchased his winning Cash Five ticket at EZ Mart #503, located at 2901 Ridge Road in Rockwall. His ticket was one of three sold that matched all five numbers for a top prize of $15,232. The retail owner of EZ Mart #503 is eligible to receive a bonus of $152.32. "I heard that Mr. McCarroll loves to play all our games, and is excited about Mega MillionsTM starting next week," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Well, I want to let him know that we're excited about his big win, and look forward to hearing from him again soon."
