Sister Act: Little Sister's Tip Wins Pick 3TM Prize For Her And Her Sister

Sisters Lela Bearden and Etta Schultz of Lubbock know how to pick 'em -- numbers, that is.

(Austin, November 21) - Everybody's got a system for picking lottery numbers. Etta Schultz of Lubbock, 80, thinks she's got one, too, and she used it to select her numbers for last Friday's Pick 3TM drawing. She was so confident in her idea that she called her 84-year-old sister, Lela Bearden, and convinced her to buy a ticket, too. They each won $660 with the combination 11-9. "What a great thing to have your sister in your corner and happy to help you win some cash," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "A prize of $660 is nothing to sneeze at and arrived just in time for the sisters' holidays." Mrs. Schultz calculated that a number combination between 1-1-3 and 1-1-9 would emerge in Friday night's Pick 3 drawing because the numbers for the day drawing had been 1-1-2. She spent $10 on her tickets of different combinations. Both women were elated to learn that one of the combinations had won when they read their numbers in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal the next morning. They both claimed their prizes on Monday at the Lubbock Claim Center, and were so excited that they could hardly fill out the claim form.
