Cash FiveTM Winner Remembers Homeless Man On Bench -- And Paying It Forward

Keith Morgan of Carrollton, winner of Cash Five prize.

(Austin, November 19) - When Keith Morgan learned he had won more than $48,000 playing Cash Five from the Texas Lottery®, his thoughts turned to a simple act of kindness last summer. Morgan was en route to Louisiana from his home in Carrollton when he and his wife, Debbie, made a stop in Marshall in East Texas. "There was a homeless man sitting on a bench outside the store where we stopped, and it was like he was invisible," Morgan remembered. "Everyone just walked right by him." Morgan said he felt this compelling urge to give the man some money. "I just had to do it," he recalled. "So as we drove away, I stopped and gave him some cigarettes and a $20 bill. I didn't expect anything in return." That hot day came back to him when Morgan read the Texas Lottery® results in the Dallas Morning News for Thursday, November 13, and discovered he'd matched all Cash Five numbers for the top prize of $48,931. "You just never know when something good will come back to you," said Morgan. Morgan bought his ticket at Aaron's Mobil in Carrollton, which is eligible to receive a 1 percent bonus of $489.31 for selling the top prize winning ticket. "Mr. Morgan claimed his prize at our Dallas Claim Center," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Our staff enjoys meeting our winners and they were moved by his 'pay it forward' story."
