(Austin, November 19) - No problems here. At least not for Mohammad Golshan, who today, became the 82nd Lotto TexasTM winner from Harris County. Golshan claimed his part of the Lotto jackpot from the Saturday, November 8 drawing, worth $29 million. There were two tickets that matched all five numbers plus the Bonus Ball for the drawing. "Houston and its surrounding area have traditionally been one of the Texas Lottery's highest selling districts," Executive Director Reagan E. Greer stated. "We're very happy for Mr. Golshan, and wish him all the best with his prize, which came to more than $8.8 million." Golshan, who chose the Cash Value Option, purchased his ticket at Fiesta Mart #19, located at 1005 Blalock in Houston. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus of $145,000 for selling the jackpot winning Lotto Texas ticket. The second Lotto ticket was sold in Texas City at the T & T Food Mart, located at 7320 FM 1765. The retail owner is also eligible to receive a bonus of $145,000 for selling a winning ticket.
