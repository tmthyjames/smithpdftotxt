Saturday Marks 11th Anniversary Of First Lotto TexasTM Drawing
(Austin, November 14) - It was just eleven years ago that those little balls first tumbled around in a Lotto TexasTM drawings machine, carrying the dreams of thousands of Texas Lottery® players looking for a piece of the Lotto Texas jackpot. "Lotto Texas has been good for players, the State and our retailers," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Our Lotto jackpots ranged from $2 million to $85 million, and players hit the jackpot more than 480 times," said Greer. "We paid out more than $4.4 billion in total prizes and generated almost $3.4 billion for the State." Greer said the game also had an impact on local economies with more than $444 million paid in commissions to local retailers. Lotto Texas has become synonymous with the Lottery itself, with "playing the Lotto" becoming the catch phrase for the full range of Texas Lottery games that now includes four on-line games, and the traditional Scratch Off games. "This anniversary of the first jackpot drawing comes at a time when the Lottery is just weeks away from launching another big jackpot game, Mega Millions," said Greer. Texas is the eleventh state to offer Mega MillionsTM - a game with jackpots that start at $10 million and average more than $42 million. "With Mega Millions on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Lotto on Wednesdays and Saturdays, we're offering our players a chance to win big jackpots four nights a week," said Greer. As we light up the candles on Lotto's anniversary cake, billboards are also lighting up around the state, announcing the fact that Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $5 million.
