'Come On Back, Good Buddy'...Tennessee Truck Driver Wins $20,000 From Texas Lottery®

David Miller of Tennessee is all smiles while collecting $20,000 cash prize from the Texas Lottery Hot Slots scratch game.

(Austin, November 13) - For David Miller of Lenoir City, Tennessee, yesterday was winding down the week for him. It culminated with him making a quick stop to pick up a pack of cigarettes and a Texas Lottery® scratch off game before hitting the road again from Laredo back to Tennessee. Miller (who swears he's moving back to Texas one day) won $20,000 for his stop, and collected his prize Wednesday afternoon at the Texas Lottery Laredo Claim Center. "I told the clerk, 'Give me one of those $2 tickets,' " Miller explained. "He handed me one Hot Slots scratch off ticket, and I took it back with me to pick up my trailer. When I scratched it and saw that I won $20,000 instantly, I told the guy at the dock loading my trailer that I needed to leave again for a minute. "I found out there was a claim center here in Laredo, and came to get my money," he said. Miller told lottery officials he plans to catch up on bills and pay for Christmas presents. "I have three boys, so this will come in handy," he said. "We heard Mr. Miller volunteered to change his handle to 'The $20,000 Man,' " said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "We won't hold him to that, but we do congratulate him on his win and look forward to the next time he comes rolling through Texas and wins again." Miller purchased his ticket at the Pilot 377 store, located at 1101 Uniroyal Drive in Laredo. The Hot Slots scratch off game offers players a chance to win a top cash prize of $20,000. Other cash prizes include: $2,000, $100, $70, $50, $20, $10, $5, $4 and $2. There are nine $20,000 top prizes left in the game.
