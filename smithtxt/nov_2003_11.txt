'Tis The Season...For Laredo Texas Lottery® Player To Win $1,000 On Break The Bank

Anna Taylor of San Ygnacio is all smiles since she collected $1,000 from the Texas Lottery Break the Bank scratch-off game.

(Austin, November 10) - According to Anna Taylor of San Ygnacio, she already has her Christmas shopping paid off. Taylor won $1,000 on the Texas Lottery® Break the Bank scratch-off ticket. She collected her cash prize from the Texas Lottery Commission Laredo Claim Center late Friday afternoon. "I play scratch-off tickets pretty often," said Taylor. "I stopped by the store to trade in two others, and decided to buy two Break the Bank tickets. I went out to my truck to scratch them. "When I saw that I won on the second one, I went back into the store screaming. Everyone thought I had a wreck or something." Taylor purchased her ticket at Pepe's, located at the southwest corner of Highway 83 and Uribe in San Ygnacio. "Christmas is just around the corner, so I guess I have that all taken care of. I hope anyway," Taylor said. Players can win up to $30,000 on the Texas Lottery Break the Bank scratch-off game. Other cash prizes include: $3,000, $1,000, $200, $50, $20, $12, $10, $8, $6, $4, and $2.
