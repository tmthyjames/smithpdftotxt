Shy Guy Claims $10 Million Lotto Texas Jackpot

Wayne Schwartz of Winters (far right) and his family enjoy a day at the Texas Lottery and collect $10 million Lotto Texas jackpot from October 1.

(Austin, November 5) - Wayne Schwartz doesn't say a whole lot, most of the time. Now, however, he has to speak to nearly everybody in Winters, population 2,880. That's because they can't stop congratulating him for having the ticket that matches all five numbers and the Bonus Ball for the Lotto TexasTM drawing on October 1, when the jackpot was an estimated $10 million. How could they not know who he is? News travels at the speed of light in a small town. And, he's been photographed in the Winters Enterprise and the Abilene Reporter-News at least once. He's also been mentioned several other times in other news items. He is a shy guy, though. His mother, Virginia, confirmed that he has said almost nothing to the local media and that he did, indeed, decline to enter the West Dale Grocery Store when he learned a reporter was in there waiting for him. He couldn't get away from the one reporter he spoke with, and that was only because she is his cousin. Schwartz came to claim his prize today. Like many winners who pass through the doors at Lottery headquarters in Austin, Schwartz said he was incredulous at first about having won. "I just couldn't believe it," Schwartz said. "I got coffee at the West Dale Grocery, and that's when I learned that somebody bought the winning ticket in that store. I made a copy of my ticket, brought it back to the store, and saw that the numbers matched." Even after he knew his ticket had the six important numbers, he still went to work at Mac Oilfield. First, though, he stopped at home and made his sister, Cathy, take care of the ticket. Schwartz later put the ticket in a bank in Wingate, but then moved it to a newer, more convenient bank in his hometown of Winters. "It gets you a little paranoid," he said.

While the new winner doesn't have big plans for himself, he's already purchased a 2004 Buick Park Avenue Prestige for his mother. He also plans to pay for his two grandchildren's college expenses. "The one thing I know is that I won't be getting as dirty, whatever I do," Schwartz said. "I might even retire from the oilfield." Schwartz chose the Cash Value Option, which makes his prize $6,351,857, before taxes. The numbers on the winning ticket were 14-23-26-33-38, and the Bonus Ball was 42. He selected the numbers based on a combination of randomly-selected numbers and the birthdays of his grandchildren. The West Dale Grocery in Winters sold Schwartz the ticket and is eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent of the advertised jackpot, which comes to $100,000. The jackpot for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing is an estimated $25 million.
