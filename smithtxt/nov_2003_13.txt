Fifth Single Highest Payout For Some Lucky Ticketholder - $46,479 For Matching Five Numbers In Saturday's Lotto TexasTM Drawing
(Austin, November 3) - Saturday's Lotto TexasTM drawing produced more than 84,000 winning tickets, and one lucky ticket lays claim to the fifth single highest payout for matching at a non-jackpot prize level. The ticket matched the first numbers, but not the Bonus Ball, and is worth $46,479, before taxes are withheld. Saturday's winning Lotto Texas numbers were: 32 - 06 - 42 - 24 - 20 and the Bonus Ball number was 14. "Although no one won the $21 million jackpot prize, we paid out more than $590,000 in other cash prizes for Saturday's drawing, making it the tenth highest payout for a Lotto Texas drawing since the new game started almost six months ago," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "The jackpot for Wednesday is an estimated $25 million, and is third highest jackpot in the nation right now, behind Mega MillionsTM and Mass Millions (Massachusetts)." The Mega Millions jackpot is currently an estimated $50 million, and Mass Millions is an estimated $37.7 million. "Players aren't going to have to wait too much longer to purchase those Mega Millions tickets here in the Lone Star State," said Greer. "We have only 30 more days until sales will start right here in Texas."
