Greenville Man Wins $100,000 With Winning Hand

William Oxford of Greenville won $100,000 playing the scratch-off game Winning Hand from the Texas Lottery.

(Austin, November 29) - William Oxford won a really big prize with a Winning Hand, ticket, that is. "For Mr. Oxford, Winning Hand proved to be just that, the hand that won him the top prize of $100, 000," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "Our scratch off tickets account for approximately 65 percent of our total sales, and Mr. Oxford's experience will tell you why. We offer exciting prizes that keep our players interested in the Games of Texas." Oxford was at the Prime Stop #2, 6310 Wesley Street, in Greenville, when he purchased several Texas Lottery® tickets, one of which was Winning Hand. "First I turned to jelly, then I made the clerk run the ticket through the terminal to make sure it was a real winner," Oxford said. "Then I told the world I'd won, my kids, my grandchildren, my friends, everybody." Oxford is letting his win sink in. He'll decide what to do with his prize after Christmas when he returns from spending the Christmas holidays in Sacramento with his daughter. "I've got a thousand and one things to do with the money," he said. "One thing I'll do is make sure the Christmas gifts for my kids and grandkids are a lot better this year. At the end of next month, I'll decide what to do with the rest." Oxford said he's won before. "I got $999 playing Find the 9's. I'm still going to keep on trying (to win the big one), though." Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot is worth an estimated $20 million. Wednesday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is worth an estimated $17 million.
