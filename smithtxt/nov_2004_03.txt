Instant MonopolyTM Top Prize A Pretty Good Prescription For Austin Player

David Davis of Austin won the top prize, $25,000, in the Instant Monopoly scratch-off game.

(Austin, November 23) - David Davis of Austin says he doesn't really have a favorite Texas Lottery® game; he likes to play them all. But that was before he won the top prize ­ $25,000 ­ in the Instant MonopolyTM scratch-off game last week. "I really enjoy playing all of the games, especially Cash Five and the newer scratch-off games," said Davis. "I've won some pretty large amounts in the past, but never anything like this, and it couldn't have come at a better time." Davis said he and his wife have had some health issues lately and they'll use his winnings to pay off some doctors' bills. He also plans to buy some more lottery tickets. "It certainly sounds like Mr. Davis is feeling better after his big win in Instant Monopoly," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "And all of our players can feel good about the fact that 30 percent of every dollar spent on Texas Lottery products goes to the Foundation School Fund, which supports public education in Texas." Davis purchased his winning Instant Monopoly ticket at Stop-N-Go, located at 3419 Slaughter Lane in Austin.
