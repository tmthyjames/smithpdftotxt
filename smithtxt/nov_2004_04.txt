Friday's Mega MillionsTM Drawing Creates More Than 87,000 Winners In Texas
(Austin, November 23) - There were more than 87,000 Texas Lottery® players who won prizes ranging from $5,000 to $2 in Friday's Mega MillionsTM drawing. "Even though the ticket that matched the six winning numbers was sold in New York City, we still had thousands of lower-tier prize winners in the Lone Star State," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "We had seven winners whose tickets matched four white balls and the gold Mega Ball for a prize of $5,000, two of which were in Dallas, with the rest in Garland, New Braunfels, El Paso, Farmers Branch and Houston. There were 87,062 winners who won a total of $512,685." Sales for last Friday's drawing totaled $3.9 million, with approximately 70 percent, or $2.8 million, of that amount occurring on the day of the drawing. Mega Millions begins rolling again at $10 million for the drawing tonight. Texas joined the Mega Millions multi-state lottery last December. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 135,145,920. The odds of winning the second-tier prize are one in 2,649, 920.
