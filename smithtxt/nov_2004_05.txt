Texas-Size Jackpot Offers 149 Million Reasons To Play Mega MillionsTM Tonight
(Austin, November 19) - No tickets in the multi-state Mega MillionsTM game matched all six numbers in Tuesday's drawing, so tonight's jackpot has climbed to an estimated $149 million. This jackpot is currently the largest in the United States and the largest for Mega Millions since July 2. The Cash Value Option payment is worth approximately $87 million. "Texas joined the Mega Millions game almost a year ago to add even more excitement to the Games of Texas, and I'd say tonight's $149 million jackpot has done just that," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Mega Millions' second- and third-tier prizes are pretty exciting too, especially in Texas, where for an extra dollar the MegaplierTM option allows players the chance to multiply their non-grand/jackpot winnings two, three or even four times." The last Mega Millions jackpot winner was Ut Van Nguyen of Carrollton, Texas, who took home more than $62 million, the Cash Value Option of the advertised $101 million jackpot for the October 1 drawing. "I'm hoping that we can make it two in a row and bring the next Mega Millions jackpot home to Texas," said Greer. "As always though, we want to remind everyone to play responsibly; it only takes one ticket to win!" Friday's drawing will be the 101st since the Texas Lottery® joined Mega Millions in December 2003. To play Mega Millions, players choose 5 numbers from 1 to 52, and one Mega Ball number from a second field of numbers from 1 to 52. Each play costs a dollar. Players must match the five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot, which starts at $10 million and increases until it is won. In addition to Friday's $149 million Mega Millions jackpot, Saturday's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $15 million.
