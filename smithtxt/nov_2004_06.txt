Million Dollar Plus Pots Up For Grabs Starting With Tonight's Texas Two Step® Drawing
(Austin, November 18) - There's lots of money to be won this week in Texas. Tonight's Texas Two Step® jackpot is worth $1.1 million, a level last seen in September. Lotto Texas® offers players an estimated $15 million jackpot for Saturday night and Mega MillionsTM, the highest jackpot in the nation, is worth an estimated $149 million for Friday night's drawing. "Players have really good odds of winning a cash prize with the Texas Two Step game," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "The overall odds of winning are one in 32, and the odds of winning the jackpot are one in 1.8 million, the best odds for winning a jackpot among all our games." In June, the Texas Lottery® changed the draw nights for Texas Two Step to Monday and Thursday nights. The change gives players an opportunity to play for a jackpot-style game every night of the week, except Sunday. Players choose four numbers and a separate Bonus Ball number for a chance to win the jackpot. Jackpots start at $200,000. To date, 11 single-ticket holders have claimed a prize of $1 million or more.
