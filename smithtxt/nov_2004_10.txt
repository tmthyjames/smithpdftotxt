Irving Man Wins Second-Tier Mega Millions Prize

Brian Neal of Irving, winner of the $175,000 Mega Millions second-tier prize.

(Austin, November 10) - Brian Neal of Irving is getting ready to buy a home, thanks to the $175,000 he won playing Mega MillionsTM last Friday. "That's a great way to spend your winnings," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "Our winners usually have set ideas about what they want to do with the prize money they've won, and Mr. Neal is no exception. He's making an investment for his family's future, the best thing he can do." Neal was reading The Dallas Morning News at the kitchen table on Saturday morning when he saw the numbers from one of the three Quick Pick tickets he purchased. "My wife checked the numbers three times," Neal said. "She jumped up to the ceiling. I still don't believe I won this much money. The most I've won before is $500." The Trammell Crow employee said that because it was the weekend, he had to find a safe place to put the ticket. "I hid it under the mattress," he said. "The Lottery's not open on the weekend, so I had to put it somewhere." Neal said he's not planning a big celebration because he won. "I'm planning to pay my bills this week," he said. "It's a real blessing to be able to pay off your bills." Al's Mobil, 1300 East Airport Freeway in Irving, sold Neal his three Quick Pick tickets. The numbers drawn were 3-41-30-2943, and the Mega Ball was 1.

Neal was one of two winners who matched five numbers in Friday's Mega Millions drawing. The other ticket that matched five numbers, but not the Mega Ball, was sold in Taylor at the Power Mart, 600 North Main Street. The player who bought that ticket also purchased the MegaplierTM feature, for which the number three was drawn. That multiplied the $175,000 prize to $525,000. The claimant has not come forward. "Mr. Neal was one of 419,219 winners in Friday's Mega Millions drawing," Greer said. "We awarded a total of more than $1 million in prizes just for that drawing." Tonight's Lotto Texas® jackpot is an estimated $10 million. Tomorrow's Texas Two Step® top prize is $800,000. Friday's Mega Millions jackpot is an estimated $106 million.
