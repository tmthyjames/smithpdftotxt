Tahoka Man Wins Big Playing Jumbo Bucks

Jesus Rodriguez of Tahoka, winner of the $25,000 Jumbo Bucks top prize.

(Austin, November 5) - Jesus Rodriguez of Tahoka asked his granddaughter, Joann Saldaña, to pick out a scratch ticket for him when he was in Lubbock's Double T Discount #2, where she works. And it was a good thing, too. "I couldn't decide which ticket to buy, so I asked her to pick one out for me," he said. "She picked out a Jumbo Bucks, which I happily scratched there in the store. Then I saw the prize; I thought it was $25." Saldaña ran the ticket through the terminal to see what the prize really was, and it turned out to be $25,000. "This is a classic example of how the element of surprise is always present in the Games of Texas because Mr. Rodriguez got the prize he didn't expect," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "We issued Jumbo Bucks on September 29 and filled it with 20 top prizes of $25,000, like the one Mr. Rodriguez won, and it's selling really well. In fact, through October 30, the game is 31 percent sold. There are 12 top prizes left." Rodriguez says he has no immediate plans to buy anything for himself with his prize. "One thing I do plan to do very soon is buy my granddaughter a nice gift," he said. "Other than that, I don't know; I guess I'm still in shock." The new winner he's got a piece of advice for other players. "I want other players to know that they should believe the commercials when they say, 'You can't win if you don't play.'" Double T Discount #2 is located at 98th Street and Highway 87 in Lubbock.
