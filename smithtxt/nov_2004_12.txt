Cowtown Resident Collects $36,180 On Cash Five® Quick Pick

Jose M. Cardona of Fort Worth won $36,180 in the October 28 Cash Five drawing.

(Austin, November 2) - Fort Worth's Jose M. Cardona likes to start his day off with the newspaper, but last Friday, he skipped the headlines and went straight to the Texas Lottery® results. The news was good ­ he'd won $36,180 by matching all five numbers in Thursday's Cash Five® drawing. "This is very exciting," said Cardona. "I'm going to pay some bills and taxes, and then figure out what to do with the rest of it later." Cardona says he plays the Games of Texas several times a week but, before his recent win, the most he'd ever won before was a few hundred dollars. "Mr. Cardona's got the right idea about what to do with his Cash Five winnings," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Another great idea is the 'Buy five, get one free' promotion currently available for our Cash Five players!" Through November 13th, players who make a Cash Five purchase of $5 or more on one ticket will receive a free $1 Cash Five Quick Pick ticket. The winning numbers on Cardona's Cash Five Quick Pick ticket were 1-11-22-23-33. He purchased the ticket at the Carnival Food Store located at 1719 8th Ave. in Fort Worth.
