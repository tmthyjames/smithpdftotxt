Acting Executive Director Continues $4 Million Beginning Lotto TexasTM Jackpot
(Austin, October 4) - The Acting Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission today decided to continue offering the beginning Lotto Texas jackpot at $4 million. In announcing the decision, Acting Executive Director Gary Grief said he wants more time to consider the potential impact that changes to the beginning jackpot, or the game itself, might have. "I want to conduct my own study of this, and other possible game changes, before I make, or approve the implementation of, any decisions involving Lotto Texas," Grief said. An earlier announcement to reduce the beginning jackpot to $3 million was made on September 26. The change would have taken place after last Saturday's drawing, if there had been a 6-of-6 match. Because there were no 6-of-6 winners, the $4 million jackpot for the September 28 drawing rolled to $5 million for Wednesday's drawing, and then to $7 million for the Saturday, October 5th, drawing. "The Texas Lottery Commission is an important component of revenue to the State of Texas, having transferred more than $956 million during the last fiscal year," said Grief. "These transfers represent an increase of more than 10 percent from the year before. I want to be methodical and thorough in my analysis before making any changes that might impact future revenue generating opportunities." Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is $7 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
