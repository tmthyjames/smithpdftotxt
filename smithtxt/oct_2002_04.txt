(Austin, October 4) - Ramiro Vela of Victoria started today on a high note. And because of a promise he made, he's going to brighten someone else's day as well.

"I play Break the Bank every day," Vela said. "I've always told the clerks that sell me a ticket, 'If I ever win a big prize, I'll give you ten percent.' I'm on my way back now to keep that promise because I feel that it's only fair, and maybe it will bring me more luck." Vela purchased his top-prize winning ticket at the Fastop Food Store #3, located at 2103 Lone Tree Road in Victoria. The store manager, Velia Gonzales, sold Vela his top prizewinning ticket. "When he finished scratching off the ticket, he said, 'Please tell me I'm not seeing things,' " said Gonzales. "He told me he would be back, and when he returned he asked me, 'Don't I deserve a hug?'

"That way, I keep more of my retirement money." Break the Bank, one of the Texas Lottery's more popular instant tickets, has been issued to players a total of 10 times. Players win by matching "Your Numbers" to any one of the three "Lucky Numbers." If players get a "stack of bills" symbol, they win that cash prize automatically. ....
