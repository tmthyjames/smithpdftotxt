First Mega MillionsTM Billboards To Appear This Week
(Austin, October 29) - Residents in Houston and Beaumont will be the first in the state to see the billboards for the newest game from the Texas Lottery®, Mega MillionsTM. "Beginning today in Houston, the first Lotto TexasTM billboards will be converted to prepare to promote the jackpots for Mega Millions," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. The billboards to be converted are at the following locations: Houston: I-610 West Loop 750' N/O Westheimer; I-45 South at Airport; I-10 West at Silber: I-10 West E/O Studemont; and Highway 59 at Commerce. Beaumont-Port Arthur area: Eastex at Crow and at I-10 East, 1/10 mile east of Workman. These are scheduled to be done by the end of next week. "The billboards will have a banner on one side that says 'Coming Soon,' and will show no dollar figures until sales start," Greer said. Meanwhile, current billboards are boasting the jackpots for the Lottery's other on-line games. Tonight's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $18 million and Friday's Texas Two Step® is $200,000.
