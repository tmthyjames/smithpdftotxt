Jefferson Woman Claims $700,000 Texas Two-Step®Prize

Alice Rice of Jefferson holds her Texas Two Step jackpot prize - she won $700,000 for the drawing on October 21.

(Austin, October 28) - Alice M. Rice of Jefferson has claimed a cool $700,000 jackpot that she won after buying only one Quick Pick Texas Two-Step® ticket. "I was ecstatic, it was unreal," she said. "You just don't think it'll happen to you." Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said Mrs. Rice proves what the agency has always said. "We always tell our players, 'It only takes one ticket to win,' and Mrs. Rice's experience proves that," Greer said. "Lots of our players walk around in a fog of disbelief for a few days after they win. Then they get past it and have even more fun enjoying their prize." The Center Point Energy employee was on her way to work last Wednesday morning when she stopped to get a printout of the winning numbers at Food Fast/Short Stop 16, 212 W. Grand in Marshall. That's where she purchased the ticket for the October 21 $700,000 drawing. The winning numbers were 21-27-12-6, and the bonus number was 32. "My husband said he thought I'd won $21, but then he took the ticket back and told me we'd won," Rice said. "Naturally, I didn't believe him, even when I was looking at our ticket and the printout. You can't believe what's in front of you.

"I've been playing for a long time, buying Lotto TexasTM tickets and scratch-offs, and I've won a number of times, but not like this," she said. "Two months ago, I won $99 playing 9's In A Line. That's the biggest I'd ever won." Rice has big plans for her big prize. "I'm going to pay off my mortgage, pay off all my bills and get a new car," she said. "Next year, during Spring break, I'm also taking my four grandkids to Disneyland." Rice says she already has her tickets for the next Texas Two-Step. "When you win, it's such a surprise that you can't describe it," she said. "It's a wonderful feeling, too, and it keeps going because people keep congratulating you. Even after getting the check, I still had a hard time believing I'd won." For selling the ticket with the winning numbers, the retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of one-percent of the advertised jackpot. For this drawing, the amount is $7,000. Tonight's Texas Two-Step jackpot is $250,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
