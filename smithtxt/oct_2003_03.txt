Hebbronville Retailer Gets $150,000 Bonus For Selling Jackpot-Winning Lotto TexasTM Ticket
(Austin, October 27) - Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer today presented a ceremonial check to the lottery retail owner who sold the jackpot-winning ticket for the $15 million Lotto TexasTM drawing on August 20. Alfonso "Pancho" Montalvo, owner of Fandango's Food Store, was on hand for the ceremony with his wife, Diana. The bonus is $150,000, which is one percent of the advertised $15 million jackpot. "We're very excited that our store sold the winning ticket and glad that someone from our town is the winner," said Diana Montalvo. "We are going to give a percentage of the bonus to our employees who work so hard for us." The winning ticket was one of five Quick Picks that long-time employee Aminta Arredondo sold to long-time customer, Benjamin Morales. As general partner of the Five Morales Brothers, Ltd., Morales claimed the $8.78 million Cash Value Option prize for the trust on September 5. "This jackpot is one that has a lot of people sharing the winning experience," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Fandango's is a great example of a retailer who has an ongoing relationship with their lottery customers and recognizes what an important role their employees play." Pancho Montalvo has sold Texas Lottery® tickets since the 'Games of Texas' started back in 1992. He knew it was just a matter of time until his store sold a jackpot-winning ticket. "This puts Hebbronville on the Lotto Texas map," said Greer. Hebbronville, with a population of approximately 4,500, is located 56 miles east of Laredo. The winning numbers were 4, 11, 14, 36, 41, and the Bonus Ball number was 25. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $18 million.
