Pick 3TM ­ Little Game With Lotta Fans ­ Is Ten!
(Austin, October 24) - Pick 3TM - the second oldest Texas Lottery® on-line game marks its tenth birthday on Saturday. Though it may not be as well known as Lotto TexasTM ­ this little ole game has its own loyal following, and a pretty respectable story to tell. Since Pick 3 was launched in October 1993, it has brought in almost $1.9 billion in sales, making it the third most popular Lottery game, behind Instant tickets, and Lotto Texas. It has also paid out almost $907.2 million in prizes. "Pick 3 is a great little game that's been fun for players and for us," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Volunteers dress up in Pick 3 numbers at promotional events like hockey and minor league baseball games and always receive a great response from the audience for the Pick 3 races." The game has remained virtually the same since it started. Players select three numbers from 0 to 9. They also choose how they want to play those numbers: Exact Order, Any Order, Exact/Any Order, or Combo. The cost of play is dependent on the play style selected, but one play is as low as 50-cents. Prizes can range from $40 up to $3,300, depending on what play style is chosen. In April 2002, drawings went from once a day to twice a day, giving Pick 3 bragging rights as the only game with a midday draw. Drawings are Monday thru Saturday, with the midday drawing at 12:27 p.m., and evening drawings as part of the 10:12 p. m. lineup of games that includes Lotto Texas, Cash FiveTM and Texas Two Step®. According to the "Demographic Study of Texas Lottery Players, January 2003," 17 percent of adult Texans have played Pick 3 at night in the last year, and 20 percent have played Pick 3 on a day drawing. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $16 million ­ but while you're at your favorite retailer ­ why not Pick 3?
