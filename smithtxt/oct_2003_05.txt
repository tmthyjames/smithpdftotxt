Mega MillionsTM Is Just Around The Corner For Texas Players Buying Powerball® Tickets
(Austin, October 24) - Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer has a message for Texas players leaving the state to buy tickets for the $190 million Powerball® drawing on Saturday. That message has two parts: "Good Luck on Powerball" and "Remember, Mega MillionsTM will be here in just 40 days." "I want to wish lots of luck to our players who are heading across our borders to New Mexico and Louisiana to buy tickets for the $190 million Powerball drawing tomorrow night," Greer said. "I also want to remind them that in the first week of December, they'll have the excitement right here at home of playing a multijurisdiction game." The target date for Mega Millions sales to start is Wednesday, December 3. The first drawing in which Texas participates is Friday, December 5. "As Texas players cross over to our neighboring states and even brave travel through Oklahoma to get to Kansas and Colorado for those Powerball tickets, I want to remind them to drive safely and to mark the days off their calendars because Mega Millions will be here soon," Greer said. "Until then, we have a pretty nice Lotto jackpot on Saturday for those staying at home." Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $16 million.
