It's Sales, Sales, Sales At The Texas Lottery®; Mega Millions Sales Start Date Announced; Largest-Ever Ticket Sales At State Fair
(Austin, October 22) - The temperatures may be cooling down in Texas, but sales are hot and getting hotter at the Texas Lottery® with Mega Millions sales starting in December, the largest-ever ticket sales being posted at the State Fair, and new holiday-themed big-prize instant ticket debuting this week. "We've got a lot to talk about today, and first and foremost on the list is Mega Millions," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Our target date to begin selling Mega Millions tickets is December 3. The first drawing in which we'll participate is on Friday, December 5." Greer said Texans will be able to see Mega Millions billboards by the time the game is launched. "The first 40 billboards will be converted from Lotto TexasTM billboards by December," he said. "By the time we're done with the conversion in mid-2004, we'll have approximately 59 Mega Millions billboards and 53 Lotto billboards." Lottery analysts estimate Mega Millions will raise nearly $92 million for the Foundation School Fund by August 31, 2004. The game is projected to net approximately $120 million in succeeding years. "The Mega Millions start date is not the only sales news we have today," Greer said. "As many of you know, the State Fair ended last Sunday, and, once again, we sold tickets there like we have since 1995. This time, however, we racked up the biggest sales we've ever had at the Fair, $393, 948.50. That's 46 percent higher than our 2002 performance." Last year's sales were $269,612.50. Instant tickets were the big sellers this year, accounting for 86 percent of total sales. Total instant ticket sales were $338,164. Sales of on-line tickets totaled $55,784.50. "Our players are not shy about telling us what kinds of games they enjoy, and our Fair sales show that we're giving our players what they like," Greer said. "That's why we now have a new concept in instant tickets that just hit store shelves. We're offering players a suite of three holiday-themed tickets with lots of $10, $20 and $50 prizes, as well as major prizes that we think will be a big hit." The $2 Winter Green has a top prize of $20,000. Holiday Bonus sells for $5 and offers a $150,000 top prize. Holiday Countdown is a $10 ticket that gives players 30 chances to win and has a top prize of $500,000. "Along with the suite, we have our first-ever instant ticket that offers a $2 million prize in a lump sum payment," Greer added. "The $20 $2 Million Spectacular is another first for us, and we expect it to generate 'spectacular' sales." Greer added that all these games are the kind that players give as stocking stuffers or as an office gift during the holiday season. "This has been a successful year for the Texas Lottery," Greer said. "We expect next year to be even more successful, as we generate more fun for our players and more revenue for the school children of Texas."
