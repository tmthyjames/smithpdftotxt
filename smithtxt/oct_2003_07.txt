Dallas resident Prisciliano Martinez collected more than $23,000 for holding a five-of-five matching Cash Five ticket.

(Austin, October 21) - Prisciliano Martinez of Dallas say he's going to visit his children this Christmas, and he's paying for his trip with the $23,119 he won for the Cash FiveTM drawing held on Thursday, October 16. Martinez held one of the two topprize winning tickets for the drawing, and claimed his prize at the Texas Lottery Commission Dallas Claim Center. "I'm paying off my American Express card, and visiting my children," said Martinez. "I have three children in Honduras, and I try to visit twice a year. This will definitely help pay for my next trip." The five-of-five matching ticket was purchased at Quiktrip #890, located at 901 West Park in Plano. The other ticket was purchased at A Plus Food Mart, located at 2475 South Cockrell Hill in Dallas. Both retail owners are eligible for a bonus of $231.19 for selling the winning Cash Five tickets. Martinez told lottery officials he has played Cash Five since it began in 1995. He also said his other favorite Texas Lottery® game is Texas Two Step®. "I plan on winning again and again," he added. The numbers drawn were: 18 - 15 - 28 - 5 - 11. "It sounds like Mr. Martinez is going to have a great Christmas, and we're happy to have been such a small part of that," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "It's players like him that have made Cash Five so successful, and we hope to see Mr. Martinez at our Dallas Claim Center again real soon."
