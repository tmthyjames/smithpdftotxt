Two Local Women Come Up Top Winners From Others' Generosity

Patricia Morales of San Antonio and Haylea West of Converse won big last week on Texas Lottery instant tickets.

(Austin, October 20) - Patricia Morales of San Antonio and Haylea West of Converse were given the chance to play a Texas Lottery® scratch-off game. They both won a top cash prize, thanks to another person's generosity. According to Morales, a friend gave her a $5 bill for her birthday. She decided to purchase a Club Casino scratch-off, and scratched her way to a bigger birthday surprise in the amount of $100,000, before taxes. Morales purchased her ticket at San Antonio Food Store, located at 1382 Gillette in San Antonio. She told lottery officials she plans on spreading the generosity around and giving some of the money to her mother. West, a waitress at Mama's Café, told lottery officials a regular customer offered her the pick of his scratch-off games for a tip. She said she chose Hot Cards because, I "liked the look of the ticket." She said she will put the money in the bank and think about any other plans for her $3,000 win. The ticket was purchased at Stop N Drive, located at 1622 NE Loop 410 in San Antonio. "Many times in the history of the Texas Lottery, winners have told us that a winning ticket was given to them from some friend or family member. Congratulations to our two newest winners who will go down in the history books," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission.
