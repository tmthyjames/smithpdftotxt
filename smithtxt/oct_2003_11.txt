Round Rock Man's Dream Comes True With Big Win On Texas Lottery® Scratch Off Ticket
(Austin, October 10) - Lots of people dream of winning the lottery. José Pedro Arellano of Round Rock did. He dreamed it and he won it. Earlier this week, he made the trip from his home in Round Rock to Texas Lottery® headquarters in Austin and turned in his Twice As Grand ticket. Arellano won the second of two top-cash prizes in the instant game, which gives players a chance to win $2,000 a week for 20 years. "He told me he had a dream and he was going to buy this ticket," said his wife, Carmelita, who accompanied him on the exciting trip. "Twice As Grand works like our very popular Weekly GrandTM game, only the top prize is $2,000 a week for 20 years," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "This game had two top prizes. A Mount Pleasant man had the first winning ticket, and now Mr. Arellano has come forward with the second top prize-winning ticket. It's nice to be part of a dream come true." The top prize in Twice As Grand comes to a total of $2,080,000 over 20 years, before taxes. The winner can choose whether the payout is weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Arellano bought his Twice As Grand ticket at Shoppers Mart #33 located at 1515 Round Rock Avenue in Round Rock. The retailer owner, Triple S. Petroleum, is eligible to receive a $10,000 bonus for selling the top-prize winning ticket. Each Twice As Grand ticket costs $5. Other cash prizes still available in this game include: $500, $50, $20, $15, $10 and $5.
