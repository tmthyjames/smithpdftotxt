San Antonio Postal Worker "Breaks The Bank" In Texas Lottery® Scratch Off Game
(Austin, October 10) - Gillis Martin stopped to gas up his truck this morning and decided to pick up a Texas Lottery® ticket while he was at Mann Chevron on NE Loop 410. He chose Break the BankTM ­ and scratched to find that he won the top-cash prize of $30,000. "It was pretty exciting," Martin said. "I couldn't wait to tell my wife." Martin, who works for the U.S. Post Office, already has plans for the money. He said he's going to pay off a few bills and buy himself a new pickup. His fellow postal workers had another idea: buy them lunch. "They were all pretty happy for me and congratulated me," he said. And his good news traveled fast. When the mail was delivered to the San Antonio Claim Center just a few hours after Martin had been there to claim his prize, the regular mail man had heard all about Martin's win. Turns out the Lottery's San Antonio Claim Center has seen a lot of area winners this week. "We had a man from Somerset win $9,630 for matching 5 numbers but not the Bonus Ball on Lotto TexasTM, and we had another Scratch Off winner who won $20,000 on Picnic Payout," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Our staff loves meeting players, and it was exciting for them to hand these winners their checks." Break the Bank is a $2 ticket with a top prize of $30,000. There were 24 top prizes in this game. Martin's win leaves eight top prizes unclaimed. Other cash prizes still available in this game include: $3,000, $1,000, $200, $50, $20, $12, $10, $8, $6, $4, and $2.
