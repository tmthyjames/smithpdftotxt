Whole Lotta Shaking Goin' On For Lotto TexasTM 5 + 0 Winner

Harry W. Swomley of Somerset gives the thumbs up.

(Austin, October 6) - Harry W. Swomley has played the Texas Lottery® "since Day One," as he puts it. He's won a bit on the Scratch Off tickets but this win is his biggest yet, and he's "still shaking." The Somerset man was one of three players to match all five numbers, but not the Bonus Ball, in Saturday night's drawing. Swomley had bought five Quick Picks for the drawing, when the jackpot was $4 million. "I didn't know I had won until Sunday afternoon," Swomley recalled. "I'd gone to visit my mom and on the way home, I stopped to check my numbers at a convenience store. "I just kept looking at the first line of numbers," he said. "I just kept looking and looking, and that's when I started shaking." He went to the San Antonio Claim Center today and claimed his prize, $9,630, before taxes. Swomley plans to pay some bills with his winnings. The numbers drawn were: 23 - 24 - 30 - 37 - 38, and the Bonus Ball 2. "We're happy for Harry, and all the other winners from Saturday night's drawing," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is an estimated $5 million. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
