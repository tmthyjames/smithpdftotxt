Not Such A Cold Day In Winters - $10 Million Lotto TexasTM Ticket Sold At Local Store
(Austin, October 2) - For a town known for such things as the Blizzards (school mascot), and manufacturing air conditioning equipment (the Manufacturing Capital of West Texas), today dawned warm and bright for Winters, Texas. A single ticket purchased for last night's Lotto TexasTM drawing, worth an estimated $10 million, was sold at West Dale Grocery, located at 501 West Dale Street. "The ticket that matched all five numbers and the Bonus Ball number is the first ever sold in Runnels County," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer, said. "In addition to that ticket, we had 60,462 winning tickets sold for last night's drawing. Players won more than $6.7 million, which includes one ticket that matched the first five numbers for a $31,505 cash prize." The ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, and is worth $6,351,857.00. The retail owner is eligible for a bonus of $100,000. Greer noted that since the re-vamped Lotto Texas game began in May, there have been more than 3.2 million winning tickets sold for cash prizes. "When we changed Lotto Texas earlier this year, we believed the changes would prove to be positive," he said. "We knew that players would think the odds unbeatable, but the facts are we're averaging one jackpot winner per month, winning anywhere from $10 million up to $47 million." Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million.
