(Austin, October 27) - The Babcock Chevron, 6392 Babcock Road in San Antonio, today became the recipient of $360,000 for having sold the ticket that matched the five numbers and the bonus ball in the September 9 Lotto TexasTM drawing. "It's been quite a while since we've visited San Antonio to give a retailer a bonus check, which makes me even happier to present this ceremonial check for $360,000 to Mr. Harry Singh, the owner of this Chevron," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The Babcock Chevron is one of nearly 17,000 retailers who are the bridge between the Lottery and our players. Our retailers all go the extra mile to keep their customers happy and help us to maintain a high level of fun and entertainment in our Lottery games. And, best of all, they help us create winners." Joining Greer was San Antonio State Senator Leticia Van de Putte. "Today's event is a great example of what the Texas Lottery does not only for its players and retailers, but also for the state," said Senator Leticia Van de Putte (D San Antonio). "The Foundation School Fund that benefits public education also gets a share of Lottery proceeds every month, as it's been doing since September of 1997. In fact, proceeds to the Foundation School Fund from the Lottery now nearly reach $7 billion, a testament to the good work this agency does for our state." To date, the Texas Lottery has transferred to the state $11.8 billion, with $4.9 billion of that going to the General Revenue Fund. Since September of 1997, Lottery proceeds are transferred to the Foundation School Fund. EFRAOLCA, Ltd. of San Antonio claimed $21,574,091, the cash value option amount of the $36 million Lotto Texas jackpot drawing held September 8.
