Austin Cash FiveTM Winners Collect $19,032 Pit-Stop Payoff

Parnell Paradysz, of Austin, and his wife collected $19,032 for matching all five numbers in the October 15 Cash Five Drawing.

(Austin, October 19) - When Parnell Paradysz of Austin pulled off the highway to fill up with gas late last week, his wife asked him to buy a Cash FiveTM ticket. Parnell wisely did as his wife asked and, as a result, the couple is $19,032 to the good after their ticket matched all five numbers in Friday's Cash Five drawing. On discovering that they had the winning ticket, Paradysz was briefly left speechless, literally. "I was so shaken and hyper I temporarily lost my voice," said Paradysz. "But when it came back, I called everyone I know." Paradysz says he and his wife play Texas Lottery® games several times a week and had actually won $200 on a few occasions playing scratch off games. He says they'll use some of their Cash Five winnings to help out family members, but the bulk will go toward a down payment on a new house. "That was a smart move on Mr. Paradysz's part to do as his wife asked, and they're both making a smart move to use their winnings for a down payment," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "I'd also like to remind all Texas Lottery players to be smart and play the Games of Texas responsibly. Remember, it only takes one ticket to win!"
