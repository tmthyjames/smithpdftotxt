Kempner Player To Celebrate Anniversary In Style After Claiming Hot Money Top Prize

Winner Andrew J. Westeen shows off his ceremonial check for $24,000 ­ the top prize in the $2 Hot Money scratch off game.

(Austin, October 15) - Andrew J. Westeen's wife can expect something special for the couple's anniversary this year since the Kempner resident won the top prize ­ $24,000 ­ in the $2 Hot Money scratch off game. Westeen says he stops by his local convenience store every morning to purchase tickets for Hot Money and other Texas Lottery® games. His biggest previous win was $1,000, also on Hot Money . This morning, Westeen checked his tickets after he got back in his truck. "I just sat there in my pickup in shock for a little while," said Westeen. "Mainly, I just play for fun, but this is proof that if you keep playing, your time will come." Westeen, who is celebrating his anniversary this week, says he's going to use his winnings to buy his wife a new car. "I want to congratulate the Westeens on both their anniversary and their winning ticket," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Even though summer is over, sales for Hot Money aren't cooling off, and that's good news for public education in our state because all net revenue from Texas Lottery sales is transferred to the Foundation School Fund." In addition to the top prize of $24,000, Hot Money offers prizes in the following amounts: $1,000, $200, $50, $20, $10, $8, $5 and $2.
