Somerset Skeptic Snags $17,000 In Second Chance Instant MONOPOLYTM Drawing

Richard Verstuyft of Somerset was the top-prize winner of $17,000 and a Franklin Mint Collector's Edition Monopoly game board in the Instant Monopoly Second Chance Drawing.

(Austin, October 8) - Richard Verstuyft used to be a little skeptical about the Second Chance Drawings the Texas Lottery® offers for some of its scratch off games. Not any more. Verstuyft was the top-prize winner of $17,000 and a Franklin Mint Collector's Edition MONOPOLY game board in Tuesday's Instant MONOPOLY Second Chance Drawing.

Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Their wise decision is right in line with our main goal here, which is to help support public education in Texas. Toward that end, we transferred just over $1 billion to the state's Foundation School Fund in the last fiscal year alone." The $2 Instant MONOPOLY game offers prizes in the following amounts: $25,000, $2,500, $1,000, $200, $100, $50, $25, $15, $10, $8, $5, $3 and $2.
