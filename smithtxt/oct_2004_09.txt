Dallas Native Spends $5 On Texas Lottery® Ticket And Wins $50,000

Arthur Nieto of Dallas, winner of the top prize of the Mega Slots scratch-off game, holds a ceremonial check for $50,000.

(Austin, October 7) - Arthur Nieto of Dallas was at his mother's house last week watching TV when he decided to scratch the Mega Slots ticket he had in his pocket. He hoped he'd win maybe $10. "I thought to myself 'this can't be,'" Nieto said. "At first I thought it was $50, so I asked my sister to look at it because I could see the three cherries and the 50. Then she started yelling. I thought she was having an anxiety attack. She told me I'd won $50,000." After taxes, Nieto's prize totaled $37,500. Nieto said his mother got in the act, too, and called a few of her friends to let them know that her son won a big prize. "It's easy to see why Mr. Nieto's sister started yelling and why his mom got on the phone, winning $50,000 is a big deal," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "Mega Slots has created a big stir among our players. We issued this game on September 8 with 12 top prizes of $50,000, and this week, we have seven of those top prizes left." Nieto says he's won before, but nothing like this. "I've won $400 playing Break the Bank and other prizes playing Pick 3," he said. "But I bought Mega Slots because I enjoy going to Las Vegas, playing Roulette and the slot machines." The odds of winning any prize are one in 3.26, including break-even prizes. Nieto collected his prize at the Texas Lottery Dallas Claim Center.
