Big Secret In A Small Town; Identity Of $1.1 Million Texas Two StepTM Winner Revealed

Winner Alejandro O. Leos and TLC Executive Director Reagan E. Greer shake hands.

(Austin , October 4) - Alejandro O. Leos of Marfa, population 2024, did what might seem impossible; he kept the news about being the $1.1 million Texas Two StepTM winner a secret in what definitely qualifies as a small town. "People kept telling me that they thought I was the winner," Leos said. "But I told them, 'I'm not a winner--yet.'" The store where he purchased three Texas Two Step tickets and two Cash FiveTM tickets sold a total of 13 Texas Two Step tickets for the drawing on Monday, September 20. In a town the size of Marfa, the retailer and practically everyone else knew who the ticket buyers were. "There's quite a difference between being a claimant and being a winner and Mr. Leos was sharp enough to make the distinction, so he didn't lie," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "It's been since midMarch that we had a Texas Two Step jackpot in the million-dollar range, so this jackpot caused a lot of excitement, most especially in Marfa." Leos said he was able to keep his "winning" status a secret, even though there were several occasions when he was almost tricked into revealing the truth. The winner is in charge of animal control in Marfa. He likes to say that he's the dogcatcher, but he does more than that. He's the one to call when a skunk or a raccoon is in the back yard when they shouldn't be. He also deals with lost animals. "The only person I told other than my family was my boss, Police Chief Guadalupe Cataño," he said. "Two reporters called me over to the paper to pick up a dog, but they were just trying to find out if I was the winner. There was no dog." When Leos told his children, Alex, Eddie and Grace, that he won, they weren't sure what he was saying. "I called them on the phone, and when I told them I'd won the Texas Two Step prize, they asked me what Texas Two Step was,"

he said. "There was silence on the other end each time I told them I won $1.1 million." Leos said he kept the ticket at the bank in a safety deposit box most of the time between the drawing and today. "For a week, Lola, my wife, put the ticket between the mattresses. Then we took it to the bank. I kept the $2 I won on the Cash Five tickets I bought. I also contacted attorney Roy Ferguson, and I'm very grateful to him for all his help." He said he plans to use his prize to help his family members pay their debts. "I hope the owner of the store where I bought the ticket really does share his prize with his employees, the way he said he would," Leos said. The Town N Country #246, 818 West San Antonio, sold the winning Quick Pick ticket. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of one percent of the prize, which comes to $110,000. The winning numbers were 16-24-4-2, and the Bonus Ball was 28. Tonight's Texas Two StepTM is worth an estimated $325,000. Tuesday's Mega MillionsTM jackpot begins rolling again at $10 million.
