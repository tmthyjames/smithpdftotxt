First-Ever Texas Mega MillionsTM Jackpot Winner Collects $101 Million Prize

Mega Millions jackpot winner Ut Van Nguyen of Carrollton receives a ceremonial check from TLC Executive Director Reagan E. Greer.

(Austin, October 4) - Ut Van Nguyen of Carrollton has the rare privilege of being the first Texas winner of a Mega MillionsTM jackpot. And what a jackpot it was on Friday night: $101 million. "This is truly an exciting day for Mr. Nguyen and all of us here at the Texas Lottery," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "This is the kind of thing that creates a lot of excitement for our players, and reaffirms what a great fit Mega Millions is for Texas. We've finally got our first Mega Millions jackpot winner and Mr. Nguyen has a Cash Value Option prize of more than $62 million that I know he plans to use wisely." Nguyen wasted no time in coming to collect his prize. He and his family got in the car at 6 a.m. today and didn't stop until they got to Lottery headquarters in Austin. "I found out Saturday morning at the supermarket when the manager there told me somebody in Carrollton won," Nguyen said. "I got a winning numbers printout and quickly saw that I had two of the numbers. When I got home, I picked up the ticket that I had left on the table. Oh my God, I said, Oh my God." His daughter Jennifer was still sleeping when she heard commotion in the living room. "I could hear him crying, and I thought to myself, my God, what's wrong with him," she said. "When I walked out there, he was standing there hugging my mother and crying like a baby." Nguyen also wasn't sure what was happening to him.

"My heart was beating really fast for a long time and I couldn't stop crying," the winner said. "Then, I don't know what happened until I called my nephew, Tuan, in Florida and told him to drop everything and come to Texas. He's going to stay in Texas now." Nguyen plans to use his money to help with the construction of a religious temple near Duncanville. Additionally, he and his family will return to Viet Nam to help other relatives, as well as build a school and assist the orphanage in the area they're visiting. "Where we come from, the school is too far away to walk to," he said. "So I want to get a school built so the children will receive an education." This isn't the first time Nguyen wins a lottery prize. Years ago, he won $40,000 dong, or $20 (US) in the Vietnamese lottery. "Every week, I buy tickets," he said. "On Wednesdays, I buy five dollars-worth of Lotto. On Fridays, I buy five of Mega Millions." Nguyen spoke mostly through another nephew, Phan Tran. "I don't know yet what I'm going to do tomorrow," he said. "I haven't been able to think that far ahead." Nguyen purchased his Quick Pick tickets at the Sack N Save #204, 1235 S. Josey Lane, Suite 600. The store is eligible to receive a bonus of $1 million for having sold the ticket to Mr. Nguyen. "We always say that people really do win when they play the Games of Texas, and Mr. Nguyen is living proof of that," said Greer. "It was a long wait for our first Mega Millions jackpot winner in Texas, but it won't be the last. I'm sure Mr. Nguyen can testify, it was definitely worth the wait." The winning numbers were 17-10-8-24-39, and the Mega Ball was 52. The jackpot Cash Value Option amount $62,060,880. Texas joined the Mega Millions multi-state lottery last December. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 135,145,920. The odds of winning the second-tier prize are one in 2,649, 920. Since December 3, combined total sales of Mega Millions and the MegaplierTM have been $235,431,916, with a combined total of $75,454,202 million of that transferred to the Foundation School Fund. Tonight's Texas Two StepTM is worth an estimated $325,000. Tomorrow's Mega MillionsTM jackpot begins rolling again at $10 million.
