RIO GRANDE CITY WOMAN WINS WEEKLY BONUS TOP PRIZE OF $500 PER WEEK FOR 20 YEARS
(Austin) ­ Irma A Reyna was still in the parking lot of the store waiting for traffic to subside when she scratched the one Weekly Bonus ticket she had just purchased. When she saw the $500per-week prize, she started yelling at her kids to turn on the lights inside the car.

"My kids said, `Mom, why are you yelling, what's the matter?'" Reyna said. "I told them to turn on the other lights inside the car so I could get a good look at the ticket. Once I saw it, I drove to my father's house to show him the ticket. Then everybody started coming over to look at it. Before I knew it, the whole town knew about it. I kept the ticket in my jeans pocket and slept in my clothes that night because I couldn't decide where to hide the ticket."

Reyna says she always buys the $1-tickets and only plays scratch-offs.

"You don't bet that much and you can usually win at least your dollar back," Reyna said. "I've won smaller prizes, but I never really thought I'd win something like this. I'd like to tell everybody that it's really real; regular people like me can and do win big prizes."

Reyna says she plans to start a small business with her total prize of $520,000. Her children, however, have other ideas for this month.

"They already gave me their Christmas lists, so we're going to do some shopping this weekend in McAllen and then the entire family is going to a big dinner," she said. "And just to make sure I made it to Lottery headquarters today, the 10-year-old and the 13-year-old started calling me at 4 a.m. to ask me if I was up already. They didn't want me to miss it, as if I would." (more)
