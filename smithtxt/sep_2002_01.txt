Granbury Lotto TexasTM Winner Back On The Road Again With Winnings

Texas Lottery Acting Executive Director Gary Grief presents a ceremonial check for $2.4 million to winner Janie Slack. Husband Danny Slack is at right.

(Austin, September 30) - Janie Slack knows exactly what she's going to do with her Lotto Texas winnings. She and her husband, Danny, of Granbury, plan to hit the road again, only this time, they'll do it in style. Slack holds the only 6-of-6 jackpot winning ticket for the September 25 drawing, worth $4 million. Slack chose the Cash Value Option on her Quick Pick ticket, earning her $2.4 million before taxes. Slack came to Lottery headquarters in Austin today and received a ceremonial check for her winnings. "When Danny and I first got married, I quit my job and went on the road with him," Slack said. She worked for the Fort Worth Police Department for thirteen years, and her husband has been a long-haul truck driver for 37 years. While the road beckons again, the Lottery winnings mean this time they can leave his big truck at home. "You might say I'm semi-retired," quipped her husband, who turned in his resignation to his employer, L&W Paving, once he was certain the ticket was indeed a winner. "We're going to visit friends in Washington State first," Slack said. "But we'll make a stop in Vegas on our way." Slack found out she'd matched all six numbers when she came home from a job interview the day after the drawing, and checked the Lottery's web site (www.txlottery.org).

"I usually wait until the Fort Worth Star-Telegram comes out on Friday to check my numbers, but something told me to go ahead and check the results right then," Slack said. "I was excited because I thought I'd matched three, and then four, and then five numbers," Slack said. "I couldn't believe it when I saw I had all six." When she told her daughter, Tina, that she had won the lottery, her response was, "What, you got a job? That's winning the lottery?" Slack bought the ticket at Tommy's Food Mart, located at 7424 Fall Creek Highway in Granbury. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus equaling one percent of the jackpot amount, which comes to $40,000, for selling the jackpot-winning Lotto Texas ticket. When she went back to Tommy's Thursday evening, everyone was talking about "the Granbury winner." She told the clerk she was the winner, but the clerk didn't believe her. It took some convincing, but when she went back into the store on Friday, word had spread that a "regular customer" had won. The numbers drawn were: 6-11-16-23-42-50. As of today, there is one Lotto Texas ticket outstanding. There has been no official contact from the ticketholder (s) of the $9 million Lotto Texas ticket from the drawing held July 13. The ticket was purchased in Dallas at the 7-Eleven store, located at 3329 Oak Lawn Boulevard. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $5 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
