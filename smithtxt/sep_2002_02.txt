Houston Resident Has Own Drawing At Home - Matches Same Numbers For Lotto Texas Drawing, Wins $19 Million Prize
(Austin, September 27) - Dudley Babin of Houston gives a whole other meaning to the term "choosing your own numbers." The Houston resident has his very own drawing at home before the twice-weekly Lotto Texas drawing happens in Austin. "I have a bag of ping pong balls with the numbers marked on them," Babin said. "I shake up the bag and pick the six numbers out." Babin correctly picked all six numbers for the Lotto Texas jackpot prize from the Saturday, August 31, drawing, worth an estimated $19 million. The numbers drawn were: 32 - 36 - 37 - 40 - 41 - 43. Babin chose the Cash Value Option and received $11,427,094. Babin purchased the jackpot winning ticket at the 7 Days Food Store, located at 5203 Griggs Road. The retail owner is eligible to receive a bonus equaling one-percent of the jackpot amount, which comes to $190,000, for selling the jackpot-winning Lotto Texas ticket. Including today's winner, there have been nine Lotto Texas jackpot-winners so far this calendar year from the Houston sales district, which encompasses 20 counties. Since January, the Houston Lotto Texas jackpot winners have won more than $67 million. Today's winner requested minimum publicity. As of today, there are still two Lotto Texas tickets outstanding. There has been no official contact from the ticketholder(s) of the $9 million Lotto Texas ticket from the drawing held July 13. The ticket was purchased in Dallas at the 7-Eleven store, located at 3329 Oak Lawn Boulevard. A second unclaimed 6-of-6 ticket was sold for the $4 million Lotto jackpot from the Wednesday, September 25 drawing. That ticket was purchased at Tommy's Food Mart, located at 7424 Fall Creek Highway in Granbury. Saturday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. ....
