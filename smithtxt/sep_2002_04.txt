Taft Lotto Texastm Winner Says, "I'm Real Lucky At Picking Lottery Numbers"

Texas Lottery Director of Operations Gary Grief presents a ceremonial check for $4.5 million to winner Alvertia Carter, who is accompanied by her family.

(Austin, September 26) - Ask 74-year-old Alvertia Carter to tell you something she's good at, and the long-time Taft resident will quickly say she's "real good at picking out those lottery numbers." Carter's number-picking prowess paid off. She correctly matched all six numbers for the Saturday, September 21, Lotto Texas drawing, worth an estimated $7 million. The numbers drawn were: 32-10-35-47-06-19. "It feels so good," Carter said. "I kept telling my husband, 'I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win. He'd always say, 'No you're not.' " Carter explained she has played Lotto since the game's inception, and used to spend $10 per week. "Then I got to thinking, I only have to win on one line, so I cut it down to $5 a week," she said. Carter purchased the jackpot winning ticket at her favorite lottery retailer, Big Diamond #36, located at 302 Highway 181 in Taft. She said she always buys her tickets there, and called the store the morning following the Lotto drawing. "I thought I had only gotten five of the numbers," she explained. "When I called to find out how much it paid out, I didn't think the girl was telling me correctly. She told me to come into the store the next day, and she would run my ticket through the machine. "When I went in on Monday morning, she ran it through and told me, 'You have all six numbers,' " Carter said. Carter and her husband, Lester, then drove to the Texas Lottery's Corpus Christi Claim Center to find out how to claim her jackpot prize. After speaking with lottery officials, she decided to claim the jackpot today. Carter chose the Cash Value Option and will receive more than $4.5 million, before federal taxes are withheld.
