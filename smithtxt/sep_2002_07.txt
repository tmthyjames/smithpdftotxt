Terrell Retailer Shares $100,000 Bonus With His Employees
(Terrell, September 25) - Terrell retailer Juan Tellez never expected to sell one of the tickets that won the $70 million Lotto Texas jackpot on June 22, but after he did, he promptly presented his 13 employees with a bonus for simply working at his establishments. "It's always a pleasure to present a retailer with a bonus for selling a big jackpot winning ticket," Texas Lottery Commission representative René McCoy commented during a ceremonial check presentation today. "It's especially gratifying to see that retailer turn around, and share their good fortune with the employees who serve as the vital link between the Lottery, our retailers and our players." Tellez received one fifth of the $500,00 retailer bonus given to the five outlets that sold a winning ticket last summer. He gave each of his gas stations employees a bonus of $1,500. The staff at his restaurant next door to the gas station received between $500 and $600 each. McCoy presented the ceremonial check for $100,000 to Tellez, owner of McDonald's Fuel Station in Terrell, as a bonus for selling one of five jackpot winning tickets for the $70 million Lotto Texas drawing. The store is located at 1-20 Hiran Road Exit 509. "We have nearly 17,000 retailers, like Mr. Tellez, who go the extra mile to keep the customers happy and help us to maintain a high level of fun and excitement in our Lottery games. Congratulations to you and all your employees for a job well done," McCoy added. McDonald's Fuel sold the winning ticket to Judy Holmes of Arcadia, Louisiana, who won $8,502,425, the Cash Value Option amount of her share of the $70 million jackpot. She claimed her prize July 3, 2002. Tellez said he'd like to meet the winner, if she's ever back in this part of Texas. "I thought it might have been a truck driver, since we get so many here," he said. "I'd like to tell her that and congratulate her, and tell her that I won, too." Selling the jackpot winner, Tellez said, greatly increased his store traffic. "The weekend after the drawing we sold lots more tickets, and merchandise, too," he said. "I've heard that this is what happens to stores that sell a ticket that wins the jackpot, but I never thought I'd be thinking about it." The Texas Lottery Commission pays a bonus to any Lotto retailer who sells a 6-of-6 jackpot winning ticket, in accordance with Lottery procedures. The retailer bonus equals one percent of the jackpot won by the customer, not to exceed $500,000 per drawing. The jackpot for tonight's Lotto Texas drawing is an estimated $4 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
