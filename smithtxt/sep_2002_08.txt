Lady Luck Hits Another Gun Barrel City Resident - $50,000 Instant Ticket Winner Says 'It Feels Great'
(Austin, September 24) - Larry Gracy took today off from work. Instead of his usual drive to Dallas as a courier, the 40-yearold Gun Barrel City resident drove into "Big D" to claim his $50,000 top prize from the Texas Lottery's Giant Jumbo Bucks scratch-off game. "I'm still in shock," Gracy said. "I called my boss and told him that I wanted the day off. After I told him why, he told me, 'Don't spend it all in one place.' " Gracy told lottery officials he could now afford to fix up a family car for his daughter to drive. "I think it's in the budget now," he added. He also said he plans on paying off some bills and hopes to put some away in savings for "any emergencies." Players win by matching any of the "Your Numbers" section to any of the four serial numbers at the top. If a player scratches off a giant "Jumbo" symbol, they win five times the prize shown for that number. The cost to play Giant Jumbo Bucks is $5. Players must be at least 18 years old to play this game or any of the Texas Lottery games. "I think on my way back home, I'll stop and take my wife to lunch. Maybe she can take the day off, too, and we'll just enjoy the moment," Gracy said. "This has just been great." Besides Gracy, there have been two other big prize winners from Gun Barrel City. In May 2001, Ennis Ventures Limited Partnership collected a $26 million Lotto Texas jackpot, and in May 2002, Bonnie J. Foster claimed her $34 million Lotto jackpot prize. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $4 million. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
