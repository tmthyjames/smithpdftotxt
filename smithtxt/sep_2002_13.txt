El Paso Resident Bargains Her Way To Winning $6 Million Lotto TexasTM Jackpot

Lotto winner Mai Fernandes and Executive Director Linda Cloud of the Texas Lottery Commission.

(Austin, September 17) - Mai Fernandes spent $9 on alterations on a skirt, spent $1 on a Lotto Texas ticket and ended up with more than $3.6 million in her pocket. The El Paso resident was the sole winner for the September 7 Lotto Texas drawing, worth an estimated $6 million. "I told the tailor that I thought charging $10 for the alterations on the skirt was too much," said Fernandes. "I told him I would pay him $9, and then I went to the store and used my dollar to buy a Lotto ticket." The El Paso resident walked into the Good Times Store #8, 3013 Lee Trevino, to check an old Lotto ticket. She explained that while she was there she decided to buy one Quick Pick ticket. "I usually buy one or two tickets," Fernandes said. "It was the second time I bought a ticket at that store." Fernandes told lottery officials she was watching the numbers come up on the nightly news and saw that she had the same numbers. It wasn't enough to make her believe what she was seeing. The next morning, Fernandes said she looked in the El Paso Times to check the numbers again, and still couldn't believe it. "Monday morning, I finished delivering my Avon stuff and stopped by the store where I bought the ticket. When I walked in, the clerk said 'You're the winner,' " Fernandes said. "I told her 'No,' but I did want to buy a paper. I didn't have enough change with me so the clerk gave me another 20 cents from a donation holder on the counter. "I went home and looked one more time and realized I had won," she explained.

For two days Fernandes walked around disbelieving she was holding the winning ticket. Finally, she told her husband, Gerald, the good news. Gerald said he didn't believe it at first because they had accidentally mixed up their tickets once before. "One time we thought we were looking at the ticket and we were really looking at one of those slips with the numbers on it that you get from the stores," he said. "I thought she had done that again." Fernandes said her immediate plans for her multi-million-dollar winnings include providing a good education for her two grandsons, donating some to charity and visiting her homeland - Vietnam - where she first met her husband. "I worked for the United States Navy as a secretary, and he worked in construction," she said. "We had the same maid, and she introduced us. That was in 1975." The two moved to England and then to El Paso, where they have lived for the last 16 years. Fernandes has worked for Avon for the 14 years, but plans on retiring and writing a book about her life in Vietnam. The jackpot winning ticket was purchased with the Cash Value Option, which equals the net present value of the jackpot amount. Fernandes received $3,635,776.80. The winning numbers were: 01-26-30-40-04-42. The El Paso area has had multiple Texas Lottery winners in the last week. On September 10, Oscar Miranda won $29,747 on the new Cash Five game, and on Friday, September 13, a jackpot winning Texas Two Step ticket worth $200,000 was sold at 7Eleven #648, located at 1490 George Dieter Drive. Wednesday's Lotto Texas jackpot is worth an estimated $5 million. ... NOTE TO NEWS DIRECTORS: There will be a satellite feed of Mai Fernandes' check presentation today from 2:30 to 2:45.
