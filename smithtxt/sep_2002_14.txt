Come On Over, We're Right Neighborly In Texas
(Austin, September 13) - Lisa Boone of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had to come to Texas to win a Lottery prize, $29,747 to be exact, playing Cash Five. "I just can't believe it," the New Mexico native said. "I've never won anything, and when I bought those two Cash Five Quick Pick tickets my mother told me to buy, I really didn't think too much of it afterwards." Boone was visiting her mother in New Colony for a few days when the pair went to the Speedy Market, located at 600 E. Sandy Lake Road in Coppell, to buy a few tickets. "The morning after the drawing, my mother called to get results," Boone said. "When she saw my ticket had the winning numbers, she started dancing around the house with her cats. I did, too." Her mother has 12 cats, all of which were rescued from being euthanized. Boone has one dog she also rescued, "a Maltese that's spoiled rotten," she said. The winner says she plans to spend her prize on her children and possibly take a cruise with her husband. "We've been talking about it for a while," she said. "But now, we can quit the talking and really do it." She claimed her prize late Thursday afternoon in Dallas. Cash Five is drawn six nights per week. The store is eligible to receive a one-percent bonus of the prize, which comes to $297.47. .... The Texas Lottery, the 4th largest selling lottery in North America, is "Focusing on the Future of Education, One Ticket At A Time." By providing the 'Games of Texas' for more than 10 years, the Texas Lottery Commission (TLC) has generated more than $10 billion for the state and paid nearly $17 billion to players in prizes.
