Record Wins: Four Texans In One Week Become Instant Motorcyclists!
(Austin, September 3) - They seemed to be from all over the place last week. The Texas Lottery Harley-Davidson® Scratch Game produced four more instant winners of a Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomTM motorcycle, and the newest riders hail from the heart of Texas' Hill Country all the way to the edge of the Franklin Mountains. The first instant winner, Gene Hooks from Lampasas, turned his instant winning Harley® ticket into the Texas Lottery's Austin Claim Center on Monday, August 26. The winner purchased his ticket at Tex's Mart, located at 404 N. Key Avenue in Lampasas. The second winner, David Meyer of New Braunfels, turned his instant winning ticket into the Austin Claim Center on Wednesday, August 28. He purchased his ticket at Pit Stop Food Mart #14, located at 2204 N. Highway 46 in New Braunfels. The third winner last week, Carl McDaniel of Abilene, walked into the Abilene Claim Center after purchasing his ticket at the same lottery retailer where he works. McDaniel's lucky ticket was bought at Tiger Mart, located at 4202 Buffalo Gap Road in Abilene. The fourth winner, Everett Potter of El Paso, scored his Harley® winning ticket at Good Times Store #33, located at 9787 McCombs in El Paso. This is the first Harley-Davidson® motorcycle to be won instantly in the El Paso area since the scratch game was introduced on May 1, 2002. To date, sales for the Texas Lottery Harley-Davidson® Scratch game total almost $41 million. The instant ticket was one of the top 10 scratch-off games for more than 14 weeks after the startup. The popular theme style game broke an industry record in the first month of sales by selling more than $12 million, beating the previous record, which was held by the California Lottery. The top prize, a Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomTM motorcycle, has been awarded to a total of 21 winners, and the top cash prize, $50,000, has been awarded to two winners. There are four more Harley® motorcycles to win instantly, and one $50,000 cash prize ticket. Players can still mail in their non-winning Harley® tickets for the fifth and final second chance drawing to take place at a later date, which will be determined based on game sales. There is one Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomTM motorcycle available to win in that drawing. ....
