Texas Lottery® Winner's Motto Pays Off With $25,000 Prize On Fast Tracks Scratch Game

Beaumont resident Charles Joubert collects $25,000 top cash prize on Texas Lottery Fast Tracks scratch game.

(Austin, September 26) - Charles Joubert of Beaumont keeps to a motto - always take the number of Texas Lottery® tickets a clerk gives you. It paid off for him today, when he won the top-cash prize on the Texas Lottery Fast Tracks scratch-off game. Joubert won $25,000, before taxes, and collected his prize at the Texas Lottery Commission Beaumont Claim Center. "I had decided to buy three of the Fast Tracks tickets on Wednesday after work," Joubert said. "The clerk accidentally pulled four tickets out of the dispenser. I told him to go ahead and let me have it. I always take the number they give me, you never know when you're going to win." Joubert is the fourth Texas Lottery player to win the top prize on Fast Tracks. There are still 11 tickets left with the $25,000 payout. "Because of all the different game themes and ways to win prizes, players have made this year's ticket sales really outstanding," said Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "Fast Tracks has been very popular because not only can players instantly win a big cash prize, they can also mail non-winning tickets for a chance to win a fully paid vacation package to a NASCAR race." Joubert told lottery officials that he plans to pay off some bills and "breathe easy" for awhile. "I have lots of plans," he said. "My wife probably has some too, but she hasn't shared those with me yet." For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www.
