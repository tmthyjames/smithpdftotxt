Canyon Man Claims Largest Texas Two Step® Prize From Amarillo Area
(Austin, September 17) - When Commie Smith stopped by the Texas Lottery® Claim Center in Amarillo earlier this week, he knew it was a big day for him. The Canyon resident had one of two tickets that matched all four numbers and the Bonus Ball for the Texas Two Step drawing held on Friday, September 12. The ticket gave Smith half of the $200,000 jackpot, a prize worth $100,000, before taxes. Giving Smith his check also made for a big day for the staff at the Claim Center. That $100,000 prize was the biggest the Center had paid out for the Texas Two Step game, which began in May 2001. "My wife was watching KVII-TV and saw our numbers come up," Smith said. "I'd already gone in to bed and she came in and woke me up. What a way to wake up!" Smith said he bought his ticket at Allsup's at Highway 385 and I-40 in Vega. "I buy my tickets there every Tuesday and Friday," he explained. "The gal there sees me pull up in my pickup and she has the two Quick Picks ready for me when I come in with my $2." The retailer is eligible to receive a bonus of $1,000 for selling the jackpot-winning ticket. "Texas Two Step continues to be a popular game for our players," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "It's a totally Texas game that's fun to play and even more fun to win!" Texas Two Step is one of the Texas Lottery's four on-line games. Drawings are Tuesdays and Fridays. Players select four numbers from 1 to 35, and one Bonus Ball number from 1 to 35. Odds of matching all four numbers and the Bonus Ball to win the jackpot are 1 in 1.8 million. Jackpots start at $200,000 and have gone as high as $1.8 million. Overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 32. In March 2002, the Texas Lottery Commission increased the amount of money its claim centers could pay out in prizes. The twenty claim centers around Texas can now pay up to $999,999. Prizes over that amount must be claimed at Lottery headquarters through the Austin Claim Center. The Amarillo Claim Center kept busy in the fiscal year that just ended on August 31. It paid $991,826 on 523 claims. $27,397 of that was for Texas Two Step prizes. Friday's Texas Two Step jackpot is $250,000. For more information about the Texas Lottery, please visit the official Texas Lottery Commission Web site at http://www. txlottery.org
