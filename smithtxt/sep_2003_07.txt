The single winning ticket was worth $61,493, before taxes. "I was reading The Dallas Morning News yesterday morning, and actually finished the paper before thinking to check my numbers," she explained. "We were so surprised about the amount of the prize. Maybe I'll be down in Austin soon after I match that Bonus Ball." Wyatt bought her ticket at Miller Mart, located at 1506 West Miller in Garland. "Mary was one of 60,416 cash prize winners from Wednesday night's drawing," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director, Reagan E. Greer. "We're looking forward to meeting her if she ever does match all the numbers, and giving her another nice surprise." The 71-year-old Garland resident said she is very active in a bowling league, playing twice a week. "I went to play last night and told one person at the bowling center about winning," she said. "By the end of the night, everyone was coming up to me and shaking my hand and rubbing me for good luck.
