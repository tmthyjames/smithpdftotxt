Last Minute Quick Picks Put Eagle Lake LottoTM Winners On Map

Bryon and Barbara Woods of Eagle Lake collect highest jackpot to date with new Lotto Texas game.

(Austin, September 3) - Bryon Woods had to talk his wife Barbara into selling him just five more Quick Picks for the Wednesday, July 30, Lotto TexasTM drawing. Today, that decision paid off. The winner, BAW Investment Trust of Eagle Lake, claimed the $47 million Lotto Texas jackpot, the largest jackpot to date for the new Lotto Texas game. The jackpot winning ticket also marks the first sold in the Eagle Lake community. "My sister called the next morning, and asked if I had heard that a winning ticket had been sold at J & K's. I had to wake Barbara up to get the tickets out of her purse." said Woods, representing BAW Investment Trust. "I got on the computer to check it out, and saw my numbers matched. I started screaming and hollering, 'We're millionaires, we're millionaires.' " The ticket was purchased with the 25-year annuity option, and the trust will receive an initial payment of $2,926,097.96, with $1,958,000 to follow on the 15th of every July for the next 24 years. Woods purchased the ticket at J & K's Corner Inc., located at 1601 East Main Street in Eagle Lake. The retail owner, Kenneth Kainer is eligible to receive a bonus of $470,000 for selling the jackpot winning ticket. "We both started crying," Woods said. "There have been a thousand things we wanted to do since we won. Those have changed, I mean, you think of things every day." "We're happy to finally meet the winner of our largest jackpot to date with the new Lotto Texas game," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "We had more than 160,000 winning tickets for that particular drawing, and paid out more than $1.1 million in cash prizes other than today's recipient."
