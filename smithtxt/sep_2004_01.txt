Plano Cash FiveTM Winner Finds Good Home For $40,703

Donald E. Lucas of Plano matched all 5 numbers in the September 24 Cash Five Drawing.

(Austin, September 28) - Donald E. Lucas of Plano visits the Texas Lottery Web site every Sunday night to check the results from his favorite game, Cash FiveTM. When he checked last Sunday, he had to call his wife in to make sure he wasn't seeing things. She confirmed the good news that their ticket for last Friday's Cash Five drawing really did match all five numbers, good for $40,701. Lucas also matched two of five numbers on another ticket, bringing his overall winnings to $40,703. "We'd never won more than $100 before, so it was pretty hard to believe," said Lucas. "We were so excited, we couldn't sleep." The timing couldn't have been better for Lucas and his wife; they made an offer on a house just last week. Lucas says they'll use their winnings to pay off some debts and apply the rest toward the down payment on their new home. "Well, it certainly sounds like the Lucases have found a good home for themselves and their winnings," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "With six drawings a week, players never have to wait long for a shot at winning Cash Five, but we always want to remind everyone to play responsibly!" The winning numbers on Lucas's Cash Five ticket were 1-4-21-24-34. He purchased the ticket at the C-Store #4 located at 2914 Valley View Road in Farmers Branch.
