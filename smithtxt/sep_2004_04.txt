Instant MONOPOLYTM Second Chance Winner Gets $17,000 And Collector's Edition MONOPOLYTM Game

Michael Bedynek of Wharton, who won $17,000 in the second chance drawing in Instant MONOPOLY.

(Austin, September 21) - Michael Bedynek of Wharton opened his mailbox and found a certified letter from the Texas Lottery. He started jumping up and down and yelling so loud that his neighbor had to come over to see what was wrong. "Oh my God, I couldn't believe it," Bedynek said. "I told my neighbor that I won $17,000 in the second chance drawing in Instant MONOPOLY. I didn't think I could win, but I had to try. It only takes one entry to win." "That's why we have second-chance drawings, so our players can get another turn at trying to win something really good," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "In Mr. Bedynek's case, he won $17,000 and a Franklin Mint MONOPOLY Collector's Edition game, all because he believed in trying one more time." After Bedynek claimed his prize at the Texas Lottery Victoria Claim Center, he returned to class at Victoria College where he is studying to be a medical laboratory technician. He will graduate in two years. "This money will really help with school," the Wharton resident said. "Tonight, however, I'm taking my wife to dinner in Houston." Bedynek said he buys his tickets at a Diamond Shamrock in Wharton. Instant MONOPOLY was issued by the Texas Lottery in July. The game was fashioned after the traditional board game created in Germantown, Pennsylvania by Charles Darrow in 1934. The version issued as a scratch ticket by the Texas Lottery features hotels as icons to be scratched and offers 10 chances to win. The players who don't win the first time get another try. There is a second-chance drawing that gives them the opportunity to win an official Franklin Mint MONOPOLY Collector's Edition game board or an official MONOPOLY prize package by
