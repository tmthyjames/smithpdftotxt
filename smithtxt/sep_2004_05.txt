$38,960 Turns Dallas Cash FiveTM Winner Into A Texas Lottery® Believer

Marie Glinn of Dallas won $38,960 in the Monday, September 13, Cash Five drawing.

(Austin, September 16) - Marie Glinn of Dallas didn't really believe her son when he woke her up after Monday's Cash FiveTM drawing to tell her she'd matched all five numbers, so she logged onto the Texas Lottery® Web site. Sure enough, she was, in fact, the lucky winner of $38,960! "I really didn't believe it until I looked at it about three times," said Glinn. "Then I just said, 'Thank you, Jesus!' This is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me." Glinn plans to use part of her winnings to pay off her car. She said she really wasn't a regular Texas Lottery player before Monday night, but she definitely will be from now on. "You have to take a chance if you want to win," said Glinn. "I'm going to play again this weekend!" "Ms. Glinn just learned what millions of Texas Lottery players already know," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "The Games of Texas are always fun, but it's even more fun when you win!" The winning numbers on Glinn's Cash Five ticket were 14-17-27-31-33. She purchased her ticket at the Kwik Way Food Store #200 in Dallas.
