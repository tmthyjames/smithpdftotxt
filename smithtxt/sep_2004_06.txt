Wimberley Woman Wins $21,000 Playing Double Blackjack From The Texas Lottery®

Winner Janelle Delaney smiles as she holds a ceremonial check for $21,000, the top prize in Double Blackjack.

(Austin, September 15) - Janelle Delaney had a 'what-the-heck' moment and decided to spend $2 on a Double Blackjack ticket while she was in a Diamond Shamrock on Ranch Road 12 in Wimberley. "It was such a gorgeous day that I thought, what the heck, I'll buy a Lottery ticket," she said. "I never buy tickets for myself, only as presents during holidays, but I thought to myself that because it was such a beautiful day that I ought to do it." The Wimberley resident had her sons in the car with her. They broke the news to her that she won the top prize of $21,000, while she was busy admiring the particularly cool September day. She immediately drove to the claim center located at Lottery headquarters in Austin. "It was a good day for our winner, and not just because the weather was cooperating," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "Double Blackjack is one of our theme games that players really like. It's now 86 percent sold." Delaney calls herself 'frugal,' and says she's tempted to pay off the balance of her car note. "The boys are each going to get $1,000," she said. "After that, I'm going to need some advice from my CPA so I can figure out what to do. I'm sure we'll spend it wisely." Delaney splurged, however, and took her sons and her neighbor, Bert, out to dinner. "This win made a believer out of me," she said. "The only thing I've ever won before this was a potted plant. I'm still stunned."
