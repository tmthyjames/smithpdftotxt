Mesquite Man Rides Lucky Streak To Top Prize In Corvette® Cash

Lowell Gaston of Mesquite is a top-prize winner in the Corvette Cash scratch off game.

(Austin, September 14) - Lowell Gaston of Mesquite has been on a lucky streak lately, especially with Second Chance Drawings for Texas Lottery® scratch off games. Gaston was a lucky prize-package winner in two recent Second Chance Drawings for the Harley-Davidson® and Corvette® Cash games. The streak continued with his most recent Corvette Cash ticket, but for that one, he won't need a second chance; he's already the winner of the game's top prize ­ a brand new 2004 Corvette convertible! "I was just sitting in my driveway when I scratched off the ticket," said Gaston. "I saw right away that I'd finally won the big one. I guess I have been pretty lucky lately." Gaston said he's a regular player of scratch off games and, with the way his luck's been going, he doesn't plan to quit now. "Considering his track record lately, I wouldn't count Mr. Gaston out," said Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer. "He might even win another Corvette. Even though most of the Corvette Cash tickets have already been sold, we've still got at least one more car waiting to be claimed and one more after that for the final Second Chance Drawing." Gaston purchased his winning Corvette Cash ticket at the Kwik Stop Discount Gas located at 4921 Gus Thomasson Road in Mesquite. In addition to the convertibles, Corvette Cash offers prizes in the following amounts: $25,000, $1,000, $500, $100, $50, $40, $20, $15, $10, and $5. The Texas Lottery will also hold one more Second Chance Drawing on September 21, with prize packages that include: Corvette Leather Jacket, Corvette Throw, Corvette Past, Present and Future Clock, a Leather Bag and Tag, and a Corvette Embroidered Logo Cap. A final Second Chance Drawing will be held two weeks after the close of the game to determine the winner of a fifth Corvette convertible.
