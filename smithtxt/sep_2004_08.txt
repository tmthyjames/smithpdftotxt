Texas Lottery Posts 2nd Best Sales Year Ever - $1 Billion Goes To Foundation School Fund

"I can't think of any better news for the Foundation School Fund than this," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "We've now transferred a total of more than $6.6 billion to benefit public education."

(Austin, September 10) - Fiscal Year 2004, which ended August 31, was the second-highest sales year in the history of the Texas Lottery®, with unaudited sales figures of all products totaling nearly $3.5 billion. These sales resulted in a contribution of $1 billion to the Foundation School Fund, which helps support public education in Texas. "I can't think of any better news for the Foundation School Fund than this," Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer said. "Our major sales increase was due in large part to our 16,661 retailers across the state, and to the players who helped us create this year's $1 billion transfer, which is $115.1 million, or 11.4 percent, more than last year. We've now transferred a total of more than $6.6 billion to benefit public education." Greer credits an efficient marketing plan for these results. "By supplying our retailers games with shorter runs, a variety of price points, and new brand-name games such as Instant MONOPOLYTM, which debuted July 21 and averaged more than $2 million per week in its first month of sales, we've kept our players interested in the Games of Texas. We've also maintained customer loyalty by continuing to issue old favorites like Weekly Grand," Greer said. "We still rank third among North American lotteries, but our numbers show that we can climb even higher. That's why during this next year, we propose to reenergize Cash FiveTM and Texas Two Step®." Sales of instant tickets in FY 04 were more than $2.3 billion. Lotto TexasTM sales came in at $477.8 million, and Cash Five accounted for $122.3 million. Texas Two Step brought in $49.1 million. Pick 3TM, with two daily drawings, posted sales of
