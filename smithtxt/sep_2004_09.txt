Boerne Woman Takes Delivery Of Corvette

Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer presents Velma Houy with the keys to one of four grand prizes in the Corvette Cash instant ticket game.

(Austin, September 9) - Velma Houy today took delivery of a silver Corvette® convertible at the Cavender Chevrolet dealership in her hometown of Boerne. Texas Lottery Commission Executive Director Reagan E. Greer presented Houy, 74, with the keys to one of four grand prizes in the Corvette Cash instant ticket game. "I'm very pleased to turn over the keys to this handsome car to Velma Houy," Greer said. "Velma was the first winner of the top prize in Corvette Cash, which we put on store shelves back in June. She bought her ticket a couple of weeks ago when 70 percent of the game was sold, and now with 78 percent sold, we still have three of these Corvettes out there in ticket-land waiting to be won." Greer told Houy she was "one in a million" because the chances of winning a Corvette in this scratch game are one in 1,260,000. Houy purchased the winning ticket from an instant ticket vending machine at the H-E-B Store in Boerne where she works.
