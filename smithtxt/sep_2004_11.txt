Hot Money Means Cold, Hard Cash For Marlin Top-Prize Winner

Bridgett Burleson of Marlin took home the top prize in the Hot Money scratch off game.

(Austin, September 1) - Luckily for Bridgett R. Burleson of Marlin, she was already sitting down when she checked the two $2 Hot Money scratch off tickets she purchased earlier this week or she might have fallen over when she discovered she'd won the game's top prize ­ $24,000! "I was just sitting on the couch and the first ticket didn't win, but I sure was shocked at the second one," said Burleson. "My husband didn't believe me at first, he said I must be looking at it wrong." Burleson's husband was shocked too once he discovered there was nothing wrong with her eyesight. Burleson, an occasional scratch off player, won $500 on a Texas Lottery® ticket last year and used those winnings to help pay for her vacation. This time, she said she plans to give some to her church and pay off some bills. "I'm just tickled pink over this, it's a real blessing for my family" said Burleson. "I play the games because they're fun, but it's even more fun when you win!" "I'm excited for Bridgett Burleson, along with all of our Texas Lottery players, as well," said Reagan E. Greer, Executive Director of the Texas Lottery Commission. "Hot Money is one of our newest scratch off games, but players have already warmed up to it in a big way."
